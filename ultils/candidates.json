Typical tasks could involve conducting market research, preparing reports on market trends, or supporting model development to forecast supply and demand or assess risk.\n\nThe programme is designed for interns to enter with an open mind, explore different sectors, and identify where they may wish to specialise. Alongside hands-on work, candidates benefit from training, mentoring from managers, and opportunities to network with specialists across the company. A key element of the internship is completing a project which is then presented to senior stakeholders to demonstrate findings and recommendations.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "EDF Trading's culture of fostering innovation, flexible thinking, and entrepreneurialism aligns closely with my own approach to learning and problem-solving.

Furthermore, the company\u2019s emphasis on respect and client trust resonates with my own strong ethical values, reinforcing that EDF Trading is a place where I can thrive and contribute meaningfully.\n\nHaving completed an internship at an EV charging startup, I have developed a strong interest in macroeconomics and global energy markets, alongside a deep appreciation for the importance of sustainable energy implementation. To nurture this passion, I actively follow developments in global energy markets and innovations in clean energy, which has only furthered my curiosity. EDF Trading embodies both of these aspects, given its pivotal role in helping businesses meet sustainability targets and its management of thousands of solar and wind farms worldwide. This gives me confidence that working here would allow me to contribute to projects with a positive environmental impact while deepening my understanding of global energy markets through direct exposure in a highly professional setting.",

I have experience doing this during a previous internship, where I presented a project to senior leadership and found it highly motivating to contribute directly to decision-making. This experience encouraged me to be innovative and produce high-quality, impactful results, and even led to direct commendation from the CEO. I would be eager to take on a similar opportunity at EDF Trading\n\nMost importantly, the nature of work across the sectors in this internship\u2013such as conducting market research within trading, building models in analytics, and using models to assess risk in quant risk\u2013aligns closely with my background as a STEM student. I have experience handling complex datasets, conducting extensive research in both academic and commercial settings, and refining my quantitative skills through mathematically rigorous work. I am confident in my ability to deliver high-quality results, having received a Dean\u2019s Commendation for my first-year performance at university and other recognitions for academic achievement. I would be highly motivated to apply these skills in the high-pressure, dynamic, and challenging professional environment that EDF Trading provides. Additionally, the opportunity to be mentored by an experienced manager throughout the internship assures me that this would be an excellent environment to further develop my professional skills early in my commercial career."

      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it brings together the kind of analytical, commercial, and ethical challenges I have enjoyed tackling in both my degree and consultancy experience. At university, I thrived on solving problems that required evaluating complex scenarios and anticipating risks, and I built on this when reviewing contracts at a consultancy, where I had to identify one-sided terms, advise the business team, and think ahead to the implications for future tenders.

Through roles such as Vice President of External Relations at AIESEC and CMS Campus Ambassador, I\u2019ve also had to engage stakeholders, secure sponsorships, and present persuasively, which mirrors the client-facing and collaborative nature of trading. Beyond work, debating, public speaking, and performing with a dance group have all sharpened my ability to stay composed and communicate under pressure. These qualities are essential in fast-paced markets. For me, this internship stands out because it is not only a platform to test these skills in a commercial setting but also a unique opportunity to grow in a sector that is central to global challenges and innovation."

As Economics student with an interest in sustainable finance and solutions to climate change, I\u2019m excited by the opportunity to work with a team actively involved in shaping how these products are traded and integrated into risk strategies.\nFinally, I admire how EDF Trading combines high performance with a collaborative and respectful culture. This is something I value deeply from my experience as Competition Captain for the University of Exeter Swim Team, as well as from my role as Finance Director of the Young Enterprise Team. From these experiences, I\u2019ve learnt that I perform best when working in a team in fast-paced environments where people are encouraged to share ideas and take on challenges, something which EDFT clearly values.",

Everyone spoke highly of EDF\u2019s collaborative and supportive environment, as well as its focus on continuous learning. This really inspired me, as these values resonate strongly with me. I am particularly drawn to EDF Trading because it operates at the forefront of European energy markets, combining commercial expertise with a strong commitment to low-carbon and sustainable solutions. The opportunity to gain hands-on experience in trading, market risk, and analytics in such an innovative and dynamic environment makes EDF the ideal place for me to develop my commercial and analytical skills while contributing to the energy transition.",
      "What is it about this Internship position that stands out for you?": "What is it about this Internship position that stands out for you?\nWhat excites me most about this internship is the opportunity to gain hands-on experience at EDF Trading, a market leader in European power and gas markets, where physical and financial trading is combined to create value for both the EDF Group and third-party clients.

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "My understanding is that this internship is not just an introduction to EDF Trading, but a high-impact immersion into the commercial engine room of the energy markets. It's designed to place interns in the thick of live projects, whether in trading, analytics, risk, or origination, where critical thinking, curiosity, and adaptability are more than just desirable traits; they\u2019re necessary tools of the trade.\nBeyond the technical exposure, this role offers something increasingly rare in internships: a clear sense of trajectory. The programme blends professional development with real-world accountability, giving interns the chance to contribute meaningfully while learning how global energy markets operate at speed. The end-of-placement presentation to senior leadership underlines EDFT\u2019s commitment to treating interns as future commercial talent, not passive observers.\nIt's also clear that EDFT values both intellect and character, individuals who think deeply, work collaboratively, and aren\u2019t afraid to challenge assumptions in pursuit of better decisions. For someone eager to develop a career at the intersection of data, strategy, and markets, this internship represents an exceptional launchpad.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "EDF Trading possess a fascinating identity, where energy, data, and global markets converge, and that\u2019s exactly the environment I\u2019m eager to be part of. The company\u2019s role in enabling the transition to low-carbon energy while remaining deeply embedded in fast-moving commodity markets is both commercially ambitious and intellectually exciting.\nWhat stands out most to me is EDFT\u2019s dual identity: a core part of a major global energy group, but with the agility and culture of a high-performing trading firm. That balance of structure and entrepreneurial thinking is rare, and speaks to the kind of environment where I believe I\u2019d learn the most.\nFrom a career perspective, I\u2019m looking to build not just technical skills, but commercial judgment, learning how to interpret markets, work with data, and make decisions in real time. EDFT\u2019s commitment to hands-on learning, strong mentorship, and exposure to senior stakeholders makes it one of the few places where interns are expected to think, speak, and contribute like future professionals, not spectators.",
      "What is it about this Internship position that stands out for you?": "What stands out most is the level of trust and responsibility EDF Trading is prepared to give its interns. The chance to contribute to a real commercial project, not just shadow the work, but actively shape it, is a rare offering. It suggests a culture that sees interns as potential colleagues, not just students passing through.\nI\u2019m also drawn to the breadth of exposure across teams, trading, market risk, analytics, origination, which reflects the complex, interconnected nature of energy markets today. For someone still exploring where their strengths lie within the commercial space, that kind of access is invaluable.\nFinally, the structure of the internship, including mentorship, cross-team interaction, and a final presentation to senior leadership, shows that EDFT has designed this programme with long-term growth in mind. It\u2019s not just about learning the ropes; it\u2019s about stepping up, being challenged, and understanding what it takes to contribute at a high level in a real-world trading environment"
