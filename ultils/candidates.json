The programme involves four six-month rotations across key areas such as energy commodities trading, market risk, analytics, quantitative risk, and origination.\n\nThe purpose of these rotations is to build a strong foundation in the energy commodities sector while giving graduates practical, hands-on experience. This includes working on live projects, analysing data, supporting risk management, and contributing to trading and origination activities. The role combines quantitative and qualitative analysis with commercial awareness, and it requires critical thinking, adaptability, and collaboration within a fast-paced trading environment.\n\nI also understand that EDFT places strong emphasis on training and development, offering mentorship, skills training, and networking opportunities. By the end of the programme, graduates are well positioned to progress into permanent roles such as junior traders, analysts, or risk professionals, and to build long-term careers in the energy markets.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it combines the dynamism of a leading trading house with the long-term vision of the EDF Group, a global leader in low-carbon energy. The opportunity to contribute within an organisation that plays a central role in Europe\u2019s power and gas markets, while also supporting the global transition to sustainable energy, is particularly compelling to me.\n\nWhat stands out about EDFT is the breadth of commodities it trades, which creates a unique platform for learning and developing commercial acumen. The Commercial Graduate Programme offers structured rotations across trading, market risk, analytics, and origination, which is exactly the type of exposure I am seeking early in my career. It would allow me to apply my quantitative skills in real business contexts, gain hands-on experience of risk management, and understand how trading decisions impact both the business and the wider market.\n\nEqually important, I value EDFT\u2019s culture of collaboration, diversity, and innovation. I am drawn to the emphasis on curiosity, flexibility, and respect, which I believe creates an environment where I can both contribute and continue to grow.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me about this Graduate position is the unique combination of breadth and depth it offers. The rotational structure provides an exceptional opportunity to gain a 360-degree view of the energy trading business. I find this especially appealing because it allows graduates to explore different areas before specialising, while ensuring that every rotation contributes to building a solid foundation in the industry.\n\nThe chance to sit on a trading floor and work on live projects from day one is also compelling. Rather than being limited to observation, the programme emphasises hands-on involvement, interaction with commercial teams, and responsibility that can make a tangible impact. The emphasis on both technical skills and professional development, alongside mentoring and coaching, gives me confidence that I would be challenged and supported in equal measure.\n\nFinally, I value the global perspective of EDF Trading. With operations spanning Europe, Asia, and North America, this role offers the chance to build expertise in an international environment, while contributing to an organisation that plays a central role in both energy markets and the transition to low-carbon solutions."

This structure will build a strong foundation across the energy markets as a whole, and allow the opportunity to explore different career paths within EDF Trading. \n\nWhile attending the EDF Trading event on Wednesday (with AmplifyME), what stood out about the role was the analysts\u2019 views of the programme, where they highlighted that by the time you graduate from the programme, you will have a well rounded knowledge about how the analytics is carried out, how to manage risk, and understand all the players, and can therefore start to trade and have a real impact from day one.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because I want to contribute to the scale and impact of working for one of the world\u2019s largest power traders, with the agility to adapt quickly to global geopolitical events. Having studied Physics, and now pursuing an MSc in Financial Technology, I\u2019ve developed strong quantitative and coding skills, which are essential in EDFT\u2019s analytics and trading teams. I thoroughly enjoyed the trading simulation at the insight event paired with AmplifyME, and what specifically interested me about energy trading was the adaptability required \u2013 I want to work in a dynamic and fast-paced role.\n\nAt the insight event on Wednesday, what resonated with me was how closely traders, analysts, risk and origination work together. I\u2019m excited to join the rotational programme across these different teams, to deepen my skills specific to each team, and gain a wider commercial awareness of the energy sector.  Combined with EDFT\u2019s flat structure and a culture of curiosity, respect and innovation, I see this as the ideal environment to contribute, learn from senior colleagues, and build a long-term career in energy trading.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me the most is the rotational structure of the programme. The chance to gain hands-on experience across trading, analytics, market risk and origination is a unique opportunity, as it\u2019ll give me the opportunity to build on my technical skills \u2013 like quantitative analysis and coding \u2013 and develop my commercial understanding at the same time, so that I can contribute effectively from day one on a trading desk. \n\nI also value how closely integrated the teams are at EDF Trading. From the insight event, it was clear that all of the teams work side by side, which creates a culture of collaboration and continuous learning. The flat structure is particularly appealing because it creates an environment where graduates are encouraged to contribute ideas from the start. That level of exposure and responsibility us rare, and I believe it would accelerate both my learning and development. \n\nFinally, the scale of EDFT as one of the largest power traders in the world, combined with it\u2019s agility to adapt to global shocks (like the Ukraine war and the pandemic), makes this an exciting place to build a career. I want to be part of an organisation that is not only shaping European energy markets, but also innovating at the forefront of the energy transition."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "As a recent finance graduate with academic and extracurricular experience in quantitative finance, my understanding of the role is shaped by the rotations I aim to complete. In origination I would help develop new opportunities, structure transactions and monitor regulatory changes with commercial impact. In derivatives trading I would apply quantitative analysis and software tools to assess market exposure and support hedging strategies that optimise EDF\u2019s assets. In gas trading I would work on portfolio analysis, pricing, logistics and storage optimisation while seeing how gas links with oil and FX markets. In power trading I would analyse flows, interconnector capacity and price differentials to identify opportunities and manage risk. Day to day this means using data, models and market insights to support trading decisions while working closely with teams across the business to create value for EDF and its customers.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it\u2019s a place where I can combine my academic and practical experience in finance with my passion for markets and trading. During my studies, I grew a small portfolio of cryptocurrency to around $50k USD and sold just prior to China's 2021 ban on crypto transactions. I sold because there were strong indicators and leaks in the communities I was a part of that there was a ban coming soon. There was enough credible information for me to pull the trigger early which ended up being the right decision, selling at an 8 month high price that would not be seen again until much later that year. I really enjoyed doing due diligence on crypto in my spare time. It gave me hands-on experience in risk, strategy, and decision-making under pressure. It probably contributed to my less than perfect grades but I made real money and learned skills that weren't taught at uni. The positive reviews from interns highlighting the analytical and collaborative culture reinforce my view that EDF Trading is the right place to continue developing these skills and make an impact for the firm.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "Rotating through both the trading and origination teams excites me because it combines the aspects of my degree and extracurriculars I most enjoyed. Analysing markets and responding to geopolitical developments in a fast-paced, hands-on environment sounds like a step up from what I love to do already at home and with the friends I made through the quant club. I want to find a graduate role that will allow me to build on my coding, trading, and modelling skills while learning brand new skills from much smarter people than me so EDF's Commercial graduate program sounds like a great fit. Thank you for considering my application. Kind regards, Aleks."

That is exactly the type of environment I want to be part of, one where high performance is expected and supported.\n\nI was also inspired by the CFO, Sylvie Billion, emphasising agility and a growth mindset as key to success at EDFT. These are qualities I have demonstrated myself, whether by teaching myself coding, developing advanced Excel skills, or pursuing a Master\u2019s in Energy, Trade and Finance. I am constantly looking to grow, adapt and build new skills.\n\nFor me, EDF Trading represents an unparalleled opportunity to learn from some of the best in the industry, contribute to a leading player in power and gas markets, and develop the commercial skills and mindset needed to perform at the highest level.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me about this Graduate position is how much it nurtures curiosity and critical thinking. That really excites me, because I enjoy questioning, analysing and applying new ideas, and it seems that excellence in this environment is built on those traits. The opportunity to gain exposure to the power and gas markets is also a major draw. For example, hearing about the stack model or how marginal costs shape power prices really interested me and made me want to deepen my understanding further.\n\nI am also very motivated by the emphasis on problem-solving, which appears to be at the core of the programme. Alongside this, I have been developing my coding skills to a strong level, so the chance to bring those skills into real commercial situations on the graduate programme would be a fantastic opportunity."

My passion for this field is demonstrated by my success in the IMC Prosperity trading competition, where my team placed in the top 2% globally by combining coding with strategic analysis to generate returns. This experience in a simulated market environment has prepared me to analyse trends and support commercial strategy at EDF.\n\n\nFurthermore, I have developed the specific technical skills required for such a role through projects like my gold price prediction analysis, where I applied machine learning techniques and effectively preprocessed data to outperform baseline models. My coursework in Reinforcement Learning at Cornell University has also given me a theoretical foundation in advanced methods for optimizing trading decisions. I am eager to apply this background to contribute to EDF\u2019s mission of achieving Net Zero, using data-driven insights to navigate the energy transition.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out most is the structured, two-year rotational format, which offers hands-on experience across a range of commercial functions including trading and market analysis. This is particularly appealing as it provides a direct opportunity to build upon my experience in designing trading algorithms and using machine learning techniques to predict price movements. The opportunity to rotate through different areas, from customer strategy to market analysis , aligns perfectly with my cross-disciplinary background in Cognitive Science and my experience using Python to analyse large datasets for non-technical stakeholders. Furthermore, I am drawn to the chance to take on real responsibility and contribute to meaningful projects that support the UK\u2019s Net Zero goals. Having led a team to second place in a quantitative trading challenge and developed predictive models in a professional internship , I am eager to apply these analytical and collaborative skills to help deliver low-carbon solutions for customers."

During this time there will be opportunities to work on real impactful projects, learn new skills and understand how all the divisions work together. Through the programme, I will gain valuable exposure to risk management and analytics, deepening my understanding of the energy markets. If the opportunity arises after the programme, I hope to apply these skills as a trader while continuing to build a strong global network within EDFT.\n\nThrough these rotations, I would also gain exposure to both physical and financial energy markets and develop a deep understanding of how EDFT operates as a gateway for buyers and sellers of commodities like power, gas, LNG, LPG, oil, and environmental products.  \n\nThe programme also includes structured training, continuous mentoring, and skills development, helping me strengthen my quantitative, analytical, and programming skills while learning to think critically and identify commercial opportunities.\n\nOverall, I see this role as a unique opportunity to combine analytical and commercial thinking, contribute to EDFT\u2019s goal of optimising energy assets and risk management, and explore potential long-term career paths such as trading, analytics, or market risk.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I first became interested in commodities during my Trading Academy at Flow Traders, where I was introduced to how commodity markets operate. This interest grew further during my summer internship at Morgan Stanley, where commodities ended up being my favourite rotation.\n\nI learnt about EDF Trading through the AmplifyME simulation, which gave me a great insight into the fast-paced and collaborative nature of energy trading. Listening to John Grey speak about his journey from mechanical engineering to trading was particularly inspiring, as his background is very similar to mine (Aeronautical Engineering). I also noticed that many graduates at EDFT come from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds, which I believe makes the workplace stronger and more innovative. Seeing senior women leaders such as Sylvie Billion was especially inspiring, and as President of Women in Trading at Imperial, diversity and inclusion are values I strongly champion.\n\nOne of my friends interned at JERA Global Markets and had an amazing experience. Knowing that EDF Trading is a one-third shareholder in JERA Global Markets, a leading utility-backed seaborne energy trader managing one of the largest LNG portfolios globally, makes me excited about the global exposure and learning opportunities I would gain here.\n\nFinally, I am passionate about sustainability. Last year I took a module on technologies to combat climate change, and next year I will be taking \u201cQuantification of Aerospace Environmental Impact,\u201d taught by an MIT professor. EDF\u2019s mission to build a resilient electricity system and support the global transition to net zero by 2050 strongly resonates with me, and I would love to get involved and contribute to this goal while developing as a future trader.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me most is the mentorship programme and the opportunity to rotate across different areas of the trading floor. I believe that to become a strong trader, it\u2019s essential to understand all aspects of the business, from risk and analytics to origination and trading, and this programme gives me exactly that exposure.\n\nI am also drawn to the chance to learn from so many experienced people, grow my network, and build strong bonds within the EDFT community. The collaborative culture described in the job description makes this programme not just about technical development, but also about becoming part of a supportive and inspiring team."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "My understanding is that the Commercial Graduate Programme is a structured, two-year immersion designed to build a comprehensive and practical foundation in the wholesale energy markets. The programme\u2019s core is its rotational structure, which provides hands-on experience across the entire trading floor through four distinct six-month placements.\n\nBased on the description, these rotations in areas like Energy Commodities Trading, Analytics, Market Risk, and Origination are designed to show how these functions interlink. For example, the work in Analytics directly informs the strategies developed on the trading desks, while Market Risk provides the essential framework for managing the resulting positions.\n\nCrucially, I understand the ultimate objective of this role is to learn how to apply strong analytical and quantitative skills to add value to the assets of the EDF Group. This means it\u2019s not just about theoretical trading, but about understanding how to optimise a vast portfolio of physical, low-carbon assets in real-time. Therefore, I see the role as a development path towards becoming a commercially astute professional who can identify opportunities and manage risk to contribute directly to EDFT's success.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "My interest in EDF Trading was solidified after hearing from a current graduate, Mithesh Duddekunta, during my AmplifyME programme. He provided a compelling, first-hand account of the firm's culture, emphasising the significant level of responsibility given to graduates and the open, collaborative environment. His description of working directly with senior traders on meaningful projects brought to life the job description's promise of a culture where employees are encouraged to speak up and their contributions are genuinely valued. It became clear that EDFT is a meritocracy where learning and making a direct impact are prioritized from day one.\n\nThis cultural aspect, combined with EDFT's position as a premier asset-backed trader, is what truly sets the firm apart for me. The opportunity to work directly with the physical assets of the EDF Group, a global leader in low-carbon energy, provides a tangible, fundamental grounding that cannot be replicated at a purely financial institution. It makes the analytical challenge of the work directly connected to real-world outcomes.\n\nFinally, the firm's central role in the energy transition adds a layer of purpose to the commercial challenge. Hearing how these elements combine in practice from Mithesh demonstrated that EDFT offers the ideal environment to not only learn the complexities of energy markets but also to make a meaningful contribution from day one.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out most is the programme's structure, specifically the four distinct six-month rotations across the core functions of the trading floor. This design offers a breadth and depth of experience that is truly exceptional. Rather than just gaining siloed knowledge, this structure provides a holistic, 360-degree understanding of how a trading desk operates. It offers clear insight into how the analysis from the Analytics team directly informs a trader's strategy, while the Market Risk function provides the essential guardrails for that execution.\nFurthermore, the emphasis on hands-on real business projects combined with continuous coaching from your manager and mentor is a powerful combination. It signals that this is not a passive learning experience, but a genuine apprenticeship where graduates are expected to contribute meaningfully while receiving the dedicated support necessary to succeed and grow.\nFinally, the fact that the programme has a clear and proven track record of developing graduates into key roles such as junior traders and analysts is a significant differentiator. It shows that this is a long-term investment in talent, offering a tangible and exciting career path, not just a two-year position."

This role stands out to me as it not only allows for practical involvement in commodities trading but also provides structured training that will deepen my knowledge of the industry and refine my professional skills.\n\nI am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on real projects that will allow me to contribute meaningfully while learning from experienced teams. The programme's strong focus on mentorship and regular feedback is appealing, as it will enable me to grow and continuously improve. I value that EDFT emphasises collaboration and inclusivity, and I believe this culture will empower me to reach my potential.\n\nThe opportunity to interact with commercial teams and leaders globally is also compelling, as it will help me build valuable industry connections and enhance my understanding of the commercial side of energy trading.\n\nWith my interest in the energy sector and analytical mindset, I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to and growing within EDFT\u2019s innovative environment.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "Through researching EDF Trading, I hear of the vital, positive culture; and flat hierarchy in which decisions are driven by collective consensus. Having experienced a similar environment at Bernstein, where I have been actively involved in the research process and have expressed my opinions as an intern, I can appreciate the benefits of promoting an inclusive, collaborative and diverse working environment.\n\nThe position EDF Trading occupies in the market is unmatched and therefore fosters a resilient and progressive environment to learn and develop. Further, the energy markets are of real interest to me. During my time at Bernstein, I was fascinated by the Oil & Gas team's coverage of Europe's largest energy players. Although the analysis of the companies themselves was interesting, it was the industrial trends I found exciting. Following the recent news where the OPEC+ nations announced they would increase crude supply, I was genuinely excited to see its impact in the markets the next day at work. This experience instilled confidence of my interest in commodity markets and trading, but energy products like oil and gas.\n\nFurther, EDFT's leading position in low-carbon energy trading, through products like nuclear and other renewables is invigorating. During my studies of physics at A-level, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about nuclear power and appreciate its feasibility debate in today's world, like many other renewable energy sources.\n\nIn summary, the inclusive and collaborative environment at EDFT allied to its industry leading position and research, is what attracts me so strongly to the firm.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "This graduate position at EDF Trading stands out to me as it provides a rare opportunity to gain firsthand experience in the highly dynamic and impactful energy trading industry. This exposure alone is appealing, but to at a company like EDF which operates at the forefront of the energy markets elevates the programme further. The structured programme offers not only hands-on project involvement but also continuous training in industry-specific and professional skills, which I see as a great platform to accelerate my understanding of the energy markets and build essential skills for a career in this industry.\n\nI\u2019m particularly drawn to EDFT\u2019s commitment to both innovation and diversity. Working in an environment that values respect and collaboration, while also encouraging flexibility and adaptability, resonates with me as it aligns with my values and how I see myself contributing in a professional setting. The chance to work directly with skilled professionals, engage in high-impact projects, and receive mentorship from leaders in the field is truly compelling.\n\nThe breadth of roles available across trading also appeals to me, as it allows for the exploration of multiple areas within the energy trading domain. I understand that interns were able to present to management at the end of their internships which further demonstrates EDFT\u2019s commitment to meaningful, results-driven work, which is both motivating and exciting.\n\nOverall, the combination of markets exposure, skill development, and a collaborative, supportive culture makes this graduate programme a unique and valuable opportunity to start a career in energy markets."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "It is a two-year commercial programme with four rotations of roughly six months across trading, analytics and risk, and client origination. You learn how EDF Trading prices and hedges power, gas, LNG and environmental products, how asset optionality is managed, and how client solutions are structured. Day to day that means turning market information into clear views, helping optimise positions around risk limits, and supporting origination with analysis that clients can rely on. The set-up naturally develops collaboration because you move between desks and learn the common language of risk and P&L. It also demands excellence and trust since your work feeds live decisions, and adaptability because markets move quickly and client needs vary. The entrepreneurial part is spotting useful angles in the data and shaping ideas that create value for EDF and for clients.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "The attraction is an asset-backed platform where commercial judgment is grounded in real flows and client outcomes. That matches how I like to work. At Tradeview Capital I built investment models for live decisions and, with a co-intern, cleaned inconsistent market data so our inputs were reliable. At PwC I ran scenario analysis on a 26-entity restructuring and delivered under tight deadlines. As M1 Volleyball Manager I aligned a diverse squad around KPIs and secured funding. Those experiences taught me to work across teams, protect decision quality, and take ownership for results, which is how EDF Trading describes its culture in practice. I want to bring that mindset to a place where collaboration is expected, trust is earned through clean analysis and consistent delivery, and excellence shows up in how clients are served.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "The combination of trading-floor exposure, client-facing origination, and structured rotations stands out. I want to see how prices really form in power and gas, how hedges and optionality protect asset value over time, and how a client brief becomes a workable structure. Rotations give me the breadth to find where I create the most value while learning the constraints and language of each desk. In analytics and risk I would apply the data hygiene habits I built at Tradeview so the desk can trust the numbers. On a trading seat I would use the hypothesis-test rhythm I learned at PwC to act with control when the tape moves. In origination I would combine listening and clear communication to build practical proposals. The programme looks like a direct path to becoming commercially literate, risk-disciplined, and client focused, which is exactly the kind of training environment I am looking for."

My experiences at Aon, AISN Group, and Halifax have built the analytical, client-facing, and interpersonal skills needed to thrive in a fast-paced commercial environment, while my leadership roles at Nottingham Consulting Network and as a youth football coach show my initiative and ability to motivate others. Furthermore, taking part in the EDF energy trading simulator really motivated me to apply as it opened up a very exciting career path for me. Getting to listen to Head of Trading, John Grey was also insightful and hearing how highly he spoke of EDF further spurred me to apply here. The rotational programme excites me as it offers the chance to develop these skills further across trading, digital strategy, and customer experience while contributing to meaningful projects that shape the future of energy.",

It\u2019s not just observation: graduates are really involved in building models, analysing risk and contributing to the desk\u2019s decisions.\nI also value the unique mix between the financial dimension derivatives, pricing, risk and the physical one logistics, capacity optimisation, power and gas flows which you don\u2019t find in a pure banking environment.

That combination is exactly what makes this programme so appealing to me.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I was fortunate to do a first internship at EDF, in the pricing team, and that gave me a first exposure to EDF Trading. We had someone from EDF Trading presenting the market news and the gas prices. I joined just after the cut-off of Russian gas during the war in Ukraine, so I could really see the impact of geopolitical shocks on energy markets.\nI also worked on quantitative projects with mathematical models, and the team gave me a lot of guidance. Later, I attended a two-hour presentation about analytics and trading, which helped me understand concepts like gas power spreads.\nThese experiences convinced me that EDF Trading is at the intersection of quantitative modelling, market expertise and physical flows, which is exactly the environment I want to grow in. The culture of innovation and diversity here also resonates a lot with me.",

It\u2019s the best way to understand the full picture before specialising.\nI\u2019m particularly curious and eager to explore different perspectives from building models and programming, to understanding products and hedging strategies, to developing the commercial side of the business.

That combination of physical and financial markets is unique, and that\u2019s why this programme really stands out to me."

During this time, commodities trading was not only the most enjoyable of all experiences but also one for which I seemed to have the most natural aptitude. Understanding energy-related news signals helped me score among the top 10 participants in the Summer Analyst training, as well as rank third in my group within the AmplifyMe EDF Markets and Quant Simulation event. \n\nMoreover, the rotational nature of this role allows me to try out everything I enjoy. As a MSc Mathematical Finance student, I am drawn to more quantitative aspects of energy market roles. Additionally, I wrote my undergraduate dissertation on pricing and hedging using neural networks through a risk management perspective, which I am excited to explore further. Lastly, I enjoy collaboration as well as roles that involve people, so I am eager to learn more about the client-facing roles within EDF."

That balance of technical analysis and collaboration is something I really enjoy \u2014 during my placement at Honda Motor Europe I worked with teams across multiple regions, testing financial controls and presenting findings to senior stakeholders. I found that combining the detail of the numbers with clear communication was where I had the biggest impact, and I think that experience translates well into what EDF is looking for.\nWhat excites me most, though, is the bigger picture.

In addition, my extracurricular roles \u2014 such as managing budgets and securing funding as Treasurer of the UEA Golf Club \u2014 strengthened my ability to think commercially and make informed financial decisions.

      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me about this Graduate position is the combination of early responsibility, structured development, and the chance to contribute to a sector that is both commercially challenging and socially important. The rotational nature of the programme really appeals to me because it means I won\u2019t just be confined to one area \u2014 I\u2019ll be able to experience different parts of the business, broaden my perspective, and build a more rounded commercial skill set before deciding where I can make the biggest impact.\nWhat also makes this position stand out is the balance between analysis and collaboration. I enjoy working with data and identifying insights, but I also enjoy the people side \u2014 presenting findings, influencing decisions, and working with colleagues to solve problems. During my placement at Honda Motor Europe, for example, I carried out financial control testing but also worked closely with stakeholders across multiple regions to explain results and recommend improvements. Having that mix of technical and interpersonal challenge is something I value, and I see the same in this role.\nFinally, what excites me most is the opportunity to develop within EDF, an organisation that is central to the UK\u2019s energy future. Being able to grow as a commercial professional while contributing to projects that help drive the transition to net zero makes this graduate programme feel both professionally rewarding and personally meaningful."
