      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "From the job description, I understand that the Programme is a structured two-year scheme designed to give graduates broad exposure to the energy markets and the trading floor. The programme involves four six-month rotations across key areas such as energy commodities trading, market risk, analytics, quantitative risk, and origination.\n\nThe purpose of these rotations is to build a strong foundation in the energy commodities sector while giving graduates practical, hands-on experience. This includes working on live projects, analysing data, supporting risk management, and contributing to trading and origination activities. The role combines quantitative and qualitative analysis with commercial awareness, and it requires critical thinking, adaptability, and collaboration within a fast-paced trading environment.\n\nI also understand that EDFT places strong emphasis on training and development, offering mentorship, skills training, and networking opportunities. By the end of the programme, graduates are well positioned to progress into permanent roles such as junior traders, analysts, or risk professionals, and to build long-term careers in the energy markets.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it combines the dynamism of a leading trading house with the long-term vision of the EDF Group, a global leader in low-carbon energy. The opportunity to contribute within an organisation that plays a central role in Europe\u2019s power and gas markets, while also supporting the global transition to sustainable energy, is particularly compelling to me.\n\nWhat stands out about EDFT is the breadth of commodities it trades, which creates a unique platform for learning and developing commercial acumen. The Commercial Graduate Programme offers structured rotations across trading, market risk, analytics, and origination, which is exactly the type of exposure I am seeking early in my career. It would allow me to apply my quantitative skills in real business contexts, gain hands-on experience of risk management, and understand how trading decisions impact both the business and the wider market.\n\nEqually important, I value EDFT\u2019s culture of collaboration, diversity, and innovation. I am drawn to the emphasis on curiosity, flexibility, and respect, which I believe creates an environment where I can both contribute and continue to grow.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me about this Graduate position is the unique combination of breadth and depth it offers. The rotational structure provides an exceptional opportunity to gain a 360-degree view of the energy trading business. I find this especially appealing because it allows graduates to explore different areas before specialising, while ensuring that every rotation contributes to building a solid foundation in the industry.\n\nThe chance to sit on a trading floor and work on live projects from day one is also compelling. Rather than being limited to observation, the programme emphasises hands-on involvement, interaction with commercial teams, and responsibility that can make a tangible impact. The emphasis on both technical skills and professional development, alongside mentoring and coaching, gives me confidence that I would be challenged and supported in equal measure.\n\nFinally, I value the global perspective of EDF Trading. With operations spanning Europe, Asia, and North America, this role offers the chance to build expertise in an international environment, while contributing to an organisation that plays a central role in both energy markets and the transition to low-carbon solutions."

This structure will build a strong foundation across the energy markets as a whole, and allow the opportunity to explore different career paths within EDF Trading. \n\nWhile attending the EDF Trading event on Wednesday (with AmplifyME), what stood out about the role was the analysts\u2019 views of the programme, where they highlighted that by the time you graduate from the programme, you will have a well rounded knowledge about how the analytics is carried out, how to manage risk, and understand all the players, and can therefore start to trade and have a real impact from day one.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because I want to contribute to the scale and impact of working for one of the world\u2019s largest power traders, with the agility to adapt quickly to global geopolitical events. Having studied Physics, and now pursuing an MSc in Financial Technology, I\u2019ve developed strong quantitative and coding skills, which are essential in EDFT\u2019s analytics and trading teams. I thoroughly enjoyed the trading simulation at the insight event paired with AmplifyME, and what specifically interested me about energy trading was the adaptability required \u2013 I want to work in a dynamic and fast-paced role.\n\nAt the insight event on Wednesday, what resonated with me was how closely traders, analysts, risk and origination work together. I\u2019m excited to join the rotational programme across these different teams, to deepen my skills specific to each team, and gain a wider commercial awareness of the energy sector.  Combined with EDFT\u2019s flat structure and a culture of curiosity, respect and innovation, I see this as the ideal environment to contribute, learn from senior colleagues, and build a long-term career in energy trading.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me the most is the rotational structure of the programme. The chance to gain hands-on experience across trading, analytics, market risk and origination is a unique opportunity, as it\u2019ll give me the opportunity to build on my technical skills \u2013 like quantitative analysis and coding \u2013 and develop my commercial understanding at the same time, so that I can contribute effectively from day one on a trading desk. \n\nI also value how closely integrated the teams are at EDF Trading. From the insight event, it was clear that all of the teams work side by side, which creates a culture of collaboration and continuous learning. The flat structure is particularly appealing because it creates an environment where graduates are encouraged to contribute ideas from the start. That level of exposure and responsibility us rare, and I believe it would accelerate both my learning and development. \n\nFinally, the scale of EDFT as one of the largest power traders in the world, combined with it\u2019s agility to adapt to global shocks (like the Ukraine war and the pandemic), makes this an exciting place to build a career. I want to be part of an organisation that is not only shaping European energy markets, but also innovating at the forefront of the energy transition."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "As a recent finance graduate with academic and extracurricular experience in quantitative finance, my understanding of the role is shaped by the rotations I aim to complete. In origination I would help develop new opportunities, structure transactions and monitor regulatory changes with commercial impact. In derivatives trading I would apply quantitative analysis and software tools to assess market exposure and support hedging strategies that optimise EDF\u2019s assets. In gas trading I would work on portfolio analysis, pricing, logistics and storage optimisation while seeing how gas links with oil and FX markets. In power trading I would analyse flows, interconnector capacity and price differentials to identify opportunities and manage risk. Day to day this means using data, models and market insights to support trading decisions while working closely with teams across the business to create value for EDF and its customers.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it\u2019s a place where I can combine my academic and practical experience in finance with my passion for markets and trading. During my studies, I grew a small portfolio of cryptocurrency to around $50k USD and sold just prior to China's 2021 ban on crypto transactions. I sold because there were strong indicators and leaks in the communities I was a part of that there was a ban coming soon. There was enough credible information for me to pull the trigger early which ended up being the right decision, selling at an 8 month high price that would not be seen again until much later that year. I really enjoyed doing due diligence on crypto in my spare time. It gave me hands-on experience in risk, strategy, and decision-making under pressure. It probably contributed to my less than perfect grades but I made real money and learned skills that weren't taught at uni. The positive reviews from interns highlighting the analytical and collaborative culture reinforce my view that EDF Trading is the right place to continue developing these skills and make an impact for the firm.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "Rotating through both the trading and origination teams excites me because it combines the aspects of my degree and extracurriculars I most enjoyed. Analysing markets and responding to geopolitical developments in a fast-paced, hands-on environment sounds like a step up from what I love to do already at home and with the friends I made through the quant club. I want to find a graduate role that will allow me to build on my coding, trading, and modelling skills while learning brand new skills from much smarter people than me so EDF's Commercial graduate program sounds like a great fit. Thank you for considering my application. Kind regards, Aleks."

Hearing about EDFT at the Amplify event reinforced my interest, as graduates spoke about the responsibility they were given from day one and the demanding yet rewarding culture. That is exactly the type of environment I want to be part of, one where high performance is expected and supported.\n\nI was also inspired by the CFO, Sylvie Billion, emphasising agility and a growth mindset as key to success at EDFT. These are qualities I have demonstrated myself, whether by teaching myself coding, developing advanced Excel skills, or pursuing a Master\u2019s in Energy, Trade and Finance. I am constantly looking to grow, adapt and build new skills.\n\nFor me, EDF Trading represents an unparalleled opportunity to learn from some of the best in the industry, contribute to a leading player in power and gas markets, and develop the commercial skills and mindset needed to perform at the highest level.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me about this Graduate position is how much it nurtures curiosity and critical thinking. That really excites me, because I enjoy questioning, analysing and applying new ideas, and it seems that excellence in this environment is built on those traits. The opportunity to gain exposure to the power and gas markets is also a major draw. For example, hearing about the stack model or how marginal costs shape power prices really interested me and made me want to deepen my understanding further.\n\nI am also very motivated by the emphasis on problem-solving, which appears to be at the core of the programme. Alongside this, I have been developing my coding skills to a strong level, so the chance to bring those skills into real commercial situations on the graduate programme would be a fantastic opportunity."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "My understanding is that this role is a hands-on, rotational journey through EDF's commercial departments, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the UK's Net Zero ambitions. I would be actively involved in shaping the company's commercial strategy by analysing market trends and trading decisions. This responsibility extends to proactively identifying both risks and opportunities across various digital and customer channels. A significant part of the experience appears to be rooted in teamwork, as I would be collaborating with different teams to help deliver concrete low-carbon solutions for customers. I would also take on genuine responsibility by leading or supporting projects aimed at directly improving customer experience and overall business performance.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I am driven to work for EDF Trading because it provides the ideal environment to apply my quantitative skills to the complex and dynamic challenge of the energy markets. My passion for this field is demonstrated by my success in the IMC Prosperity trading competition, where my team placed in the top 2% globally by combining coding with strategic analysis to generate returns. This experience in a simulated market environment has prepared me to analyse trends and support commercial strategy at EDF.\n\n\nFurthermore, I have developed the specific technical skills required for such a role through projects like my gold price prediction analysis, where I applied machine learning techniques and effectively preprocessed data to outperform baseline models. My coursework in Reinforcement Learning at Cornell University has also given me a theoretical foundation in advanced methods for optimizing trading decisions. I am eager to apply this background to contribute to EDF\u2019s mission of achieving Net Zero, using data-driven insights to navigate the energy transition.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out most is the structured, two-year rotational format, which offers hands-on experience across a range of commercial functions including trading and market analysis. This is particularly appealing as it provides a direct opportunity to build upon my experience in designing trading algorithms and using machine learning techniques to predict price movements. The opportunity to rotate through different areas, from customer strategy to market analysis , aligns perfectly with my cross-disciplinary background in Cognitive Science and my experience using Python to analyse large datasets for non-technical stakeholders. Furthermore, I am drawn to the chance to take on real responsibility and contribute to meaningful projects that support the UK\u2019s Net Zero goals. Having led a team to second place in a quantitative trading challenge and developed predictive models in a professional internship , I am eager to apply these analytical and collaborative skills to help deliver low-carbon solutions for customers."

During this time there will be opportunities to work on real impactful projects, learn new skills and understand how all the divisions work together. Through the programme, I will gain valuable exposure to risk management and analytics, deepening my understanding of the energy markets. If the opportunity arises after the programme, I hope to apply these skills as a trader while continuing to build a strong global network within EDFT.\n\nThrough these rotations, I would also gain exposure to both physical and financial energy markets and develop a deep understanding of how EDFT operates as a gateway for buyers and sellers of commodities like power, gas, LNG, LPG, oil, and environmental products.  \n\nThe programme also includes structured training, continuous mentoring, and skills development, helping me strengthen my quantitative, analytical, and programming skills while learning to think critically and identify commercial opportunities.\n\nOverall, I see this role as a unique opportunity to combine analytical and commercial thinking, contribute to EDFT\u2019s goal of optimising energy assets and risk management, and explore potential long-term career paths such as trading, analytics, or market risk.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I first became interested in commodities during my Trading Academy at Flow Traders, where I was introduced to how commodity markets operate. This interest grew further during my summer internship at Morgan Stanley, where commodities ended up being my favourite rotation.\n\nI learnt about EDF Trading through the AmplifyME simulation, which gave me a great insight into the fast-paced and collaborative nature of energy trading. Listening to John Grey speak about his journey from mechanical engineering to trading was particularly inspiring, as his background is very similar to mine (Aeronautical Engineering). I also noticed that many graduates at EDFT come from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds, which I believe makes the workplace stronger and more innovative. Seeing senior women leaders such as Sylvie Billion was especially inspiring, and as President of Women in Trading at Imperial, diversity and inclusion are values I strongly champion.\n\nOne of my friends interned at JERA Global Markets and had an amazing experience. Knowing that EDF Trading is a one-third shareholder in JERA Global Markets, a leading utility-backed seaborne energy trader managing one of the largest LNG portfolios globally, makes me excited about the global exposure and learning opportunities I would gain here.\n\nFinally, I am passionate about sustainability. Last year I took a module on technologies to combat climate change, and next year I will be taking \u201cQuantification of Aerospace Environmental Impact,\u201d taught by an MIT professor. EDF\u2019s mission to build a resilient electricity system and support the global transition to net zero by 2050 strongly resonates with me, and I would love to get involved and contribute to this goal while developing as a future trader.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me most is the mentorship programme and the opportunity to rotate across different areas of the trading floor. I believe that to become a strong trader, it\u2019s essential to understand all aspects of the business, from risk and analytics to origination and trading, and this programme gives me exactly that exposure.\n\nI am also drawn to the chance to learn from so many experienced people, grow my network, and build strong bonds within the EDFT community. The collaborative culture described in the job description makes this programme not just about technical development, but also about becoming part of a supportive and inspiring team."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "My understanding is that the Commercial Graduate Programme is a structured, two-year immersion designed to build a comprehensive and practical foundation in the wholesale energy markets. The programme\u2019s core is its rotational structure, which provides hands-on experience across the entire trading floor through four distinct six-month placements.\n\nBased on the description, these rotations in areas like Energy Commodities Trading, Analytics, Market Risk, and Origination are designed to show how these functions interlink. For example, the work in Analytics directly informs the strategies developed on the trading desks, while Market Risk provides the essential framework for managing the resulting positions.\n\nCrucially, I understand the ultimate objective of this role is to learn how to apply strong analytical and quantitative skills to add value to the assets of the EDF Group. This means it\u2019s not just about theoretical trading, but about understanding how to optimise a vast portfolio of physical, low-carbon assets in real-time. Therefore, I see the role as a development path towards becoming a commercially astute professional who can identify opportunities and manage risk to contribute directly to EDFT's success.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "My interest in EDF Trading was solidified after hearing from a current graduate, Mithesh Duddekunta, during my AmplifyME programme. He provided a compelling, first-hand account of the firm's culture, emphasising the significant level of responsibility given to graduates and the open, collaborative environment. His description of working directly with senior traders on meaningful projects brought to life the job description's promise of a culture where employees are encouraged to speak up and their contributions are genuinely valued. It became clear that EDFT is a meritocracy where learning and making a direct impact are prioritized from day one.\n\nThis cultural aspect, combined with EDFT's position as a premier asset-backed trader, is what truly sets the firm apart for me. The opportunity to work directly with the physical assets of the EDF Group, a global leader in low-carbon energy, provides a tangible, fundamental grounding that cannot be replicated at a purely financial institution. It makes the analytical challenge of the work directly connected to real-world outcomes.\n\nFinally, the firm's central role in the energy transition adds a layer of purpose to the commercial challenge. Hearing how these elements combine in practice from Mithesh demonstrated that EDFT offers the ideal environment to not only learn the complexities of energy markets but also to make a meaningful contribution from day one.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out most is the programme's structure, specifically the four distinct six-month rotations across the core functions of the trading floor. This design offers a breadth and depth of experience that is truly exceptional. Rather than just gaining siloed knowledge, this structure provides a holistic, 360-degree understanding of how a trading desk operates. It offers clear insight into how the analysis from the Analytics team directly informs a trader's strategy, while the Market Risk function provides the essential guardrails for that execution.\nFurthermore, the emphasis on hands-on real business projects combined with continuous coaching from your manager and mentor is a powerful combination. It signals that this is not a passive learning experience, but a genuine apprenticeship where graduates are expected to contribute meaningfully while receiving the dedicated support necessary to succeed and grow.\nFinally, the fact that the programme has a clear and proven track record of developing graduates into key roles such as junior traders and analysts is a significant differentiator. It shows that this is a long-term investment in talent, offering a tangible and exciting career path, not just a two-year position."

This role stands out to me as it not only allows for practical involvement in commodities trading but also provides structured training that will deepen my knowledge of the industry and refine my professional skills.\n\nI am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on real projects that will allow me to contribute meaningfully while learning from experienced teams. The programme's strong focus on mentorship and regular feedback is appealing, as it will enable me to grow and continuously improve. I value that EDFT emphasises collaboration and inclusivity, and I believe this culture will empower me to reach my potential.\n\nThe opportunity to interact with commercial teams and leaders globally is also compelling, as it will help me build valuable industry connections and enhance my understanding of the commercial side of energy trading.\n\nWith my interest in the energy sector and analytical mindset, I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to and growing within EDFT\u2019s innovative environment.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "Through researching EDF Trading, I hear of the vital, positive culture; and flat hierarchy in which decisions are driven by collective consensus. Having experienced a similar environment at Bernstein, where I have been actively involved in the research process and have expressed my opinions as an intern, I can appreciate the benefits of promoting an inclusive, collaborative and diverse working environment.\n\nThe position EDF Trading occupies in the market is unmatched and therefore fosters a resilient and progressive environment to learn and develop. Further, the energy markets are of real interest to me. During my time at Bernstein, I was fascinated by the Oil & Gas team's coverage of Europe's largest energy players. Although the analysis of the companies themselves was interesting, it was the industrial trends I found exciting. Following the recent news where the OPEC+ nations announced they would increase crude supply, I was genuinely excited to see its impact in the markets the next day at work. This experience instilled confidence of my interest in commodity markets and trading, but energy products like oil and gas.\n\nFurther, EDFT's leading position in low-carbon energy trading, through products like nuclear and other renewables is invigorating. During my studies of physics at A-level, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about nuclear power and appreciate its feasibility debate in today's world, like many other renewable energy sources.\n\nIn summary, the inclusive and collaborative environment at EDFT allied to its industry leading position and research, is what attracts me so strongly to the firm.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "This graduate position at EDF Trading stands out to me as it provides a rare opportunity to gain firsthand experience in the highly dynamic and impactful energy trading industry. This exposure alone is appealing, but to at a company like EDF which operates at the forefront of the energy markets elevates the programme further. The structured programme offers not only hands-on project involvement but also continuous training in industry-specific and professional skills, which I see as a great platform to accelerate my understanding of the energy markets and build essential skills for a career in this industry.\n\nI\u2019m particularly drawn to EDFT\u2019s commitment to both innovation and diversity. Working in an environment that values respect and collaboration, while also encouraging flexibility and adaptability, resonates with me as it aligns with my values and how I see myself contributing in a professional setting. The chance to work directly with skilled professionals, engage in high-impact projects, and receive mentorship from leaders in the field is truly compelling.\n\nThe breadth of roles available across trading also appeals to me, as it allows for the exploration of multiple areas within the energy trading domain. I understand that interns were able to present to management at the end of their internships which further demonstrates EDFT\u2019s commitment to meaningful, results-driven work, which is both motivating and exciting.\n\nOverall, the combination of markets exposure, skill development, and a collaborative, supportive culture makes this graduate programme a unique and valuable opportunity to start a career in energy markets."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "It is a two-year commercial programme with four rotations of roughly six months across trading, analytics and risk, and client origination. You learn how EDF Trading prices and hedges power, gas, LNG and environmental products, how asset optionality is managed, and how client solutions are structured. Day to day that means turning market information into clear views, helping optimise positions around risk limits, and supporting origination with analysis that clients can rely on. The set-up naturally develops collaboration because you move between desks and learn the common language of risk and P&L. It also demands excellence and trust since your work feeds live decisions, and adaptability because markets move quickly and client needs vary. The entrepreneurial part is spotting useful angles in the data and shaping ideas that create value for EDF and for clients.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "The attraction is an asset-backed platform where commercial judgment is grounded in real flows and client outcomes. That matches how I like to work. At Tradeview Capital I built investment models for live decisions and, with a co-intern, cleaned inconsistent market data so our inputs were reliable. At PwC I ran scenario analysis on a 26-entity restructuring and delivered under tight deadlines. As M1 Volleyball Manager I aligned a diverse squad around KPIs and secured funding. Those experiences taught me to work across teams, protect decision quality, and take ownership for results, which is how EDF Trading describes its culture in practice. I want to bring that mindset to a place where collaboration is expected, trust is earned through clean analysis and consistent delivery, and excellence shows up in how clients are served.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "The combination of trading-floor exposure, client-facing origination, and structured rotations stands out. I want to see how prices really form in power and gas, how hedges and optionality protect asset value over time, and how a client brief becomes a workable structure. Rotations give me the breadth to find where I create the most value while learning the constraints and language of each desk. In analytics and risk I would apply the data hygiene habits I built at Tradeview so the desk can trust the numbers. On a trading seat I would use the hypothesis-test rhythm I learned at PwC to act with control when the tape moves. In origination I would combine listening and clear communication to build practical proposals. The programme looks like a direct path to becoming commercially literate, risk-disciplined, and client focused, which is exactly the kind of training environment I am looking for."

The role involves supporting trading desks with market analysis, monitoring risk, and helping to identify profitable opportunities in energy markets, while also developing a strong understanding of EDFT\u2019s products across power, gas, LNG, and environmental commodities.\n\nIt is both analytical and commercial, requiring the ability to interpret data, model scenarios, and communicate insights clearly to traders and other stakeholders.

It\u2019s not just observation: graduates are really involved in building models, analysing risk and contributing to the desk\u2019s decisions.\nI also value the unique mix between the financial dimension derivatives, pricing, risk and the physical one logistics, capacity optimisation, power and gas flows which you don\u2019t find in a pure banking environment. On top of that, the structured mentorship and exposure to shocks and news impacting markets will give me a 360\u00b0 understanding of the business. That combination is exactly what makes this programme so appealing to me.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I was fortunate to do a first internship at EDF, in the pricing team, and that gave me a first exposure to EDF Trading. We had someone from EDF Trading presenting the market news and the gas prices. I joined just after the cut-off of Russian gas during the war in Ukraine, so I could really see the impact of geopolitical shocks on energy markets.\nI also worked on quantitative projects with mathematical models, and the team gave me a lot of guidance. Later, I attended a two-hour presentation about analytics and trading, which helped me understand concepts like gas power spreads.\nThese experiences convinced me that EDF Trading is at the intersection of quantitative modelling, market expertise and physical flows, which is exactly the environment I want to grow in. The culture of innovation and diversity here also resonates a lot with me.",

Having the opportunity to work on power, gas, analytics, risk and origination within just two years is a real privilege. It\u2019s the best way to understand the full picture before specialising.\nI\u2019m particularly curious and eager to explore different perspectives from building models and programming, to understanding products and hedging strategies, to developing the commercial side of the business. This breadth is rare, and it will allow me to discover new areas I might not have considered before.\nI also like that it\u2019s not only about financial products but also about the physical dimension flows, supply chain, logistics which makes the role much more concrete than in banking. That combination of physical and financial markets is unique, and that\u2019s why this programme really stands out to me."

      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "The Commercial Graduate role at EDF stands out to me for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, I have found that I am naturally drawn to commodities trading. I have just completed the Summer Analyst experience at AmplifyMe, during which I had the opportunity to try out various trading desks and other finance-related roles. During this time, commodities trading was not only the most enjoyable of all experiences but also one for which I seemed to have the most natural aptitude. Understanding energy-related news signals helped me score among the top 10 participants in the Summer Analyst training, as well as rank third in my group within the AmplifyMe EDF Markets and Quant Simulation event. \n\nMoreover, the rotational nature of this role allows me to try out everything I enjoy. As a MSc Mathematical Finance student, I am drawn to more quantitative aspects of energy market roles. Additionally, I wrote my undergraduate dissertation on pricing and hedging using neural networks through a risk management perspective, which I am excited to explore further. Lastly, I enjoy collaboration as well as roles that involve people, so I am eager to learn more about the client-facing roles within EDF."

The rotational structure really appeals to me because it means I can gain exposure to different challenges, learn from specialists in each team, and gradually shape where I can add the most value.\nIt\u2019s clear the role isn\u2019t just about analysing data, but also about using those insights to influence decisions, work with stakeholders, and support EDF in delivering affordable and sustainable energy. That balance of technical analysis and collaboration is something I really enjoy \u2014 during my placement at Honda Motor Europe I worked with teams across multiple regions, testing financial controls and presenting findings to senior stakeholders. I found that combining the detail of the numbers with clear communication was where I had the biggest impact, and I think that experience translates well into what EDF is looking for.\nWhat excites me most, though, is the bigger picture.

The chance to operate in a dynamic trading environment while being part of a business that plays a central role in Europe\u2019s low-carbon future is a unique proposition that really appeals to me.\nFrom my placement year in corporate audit at Honda Motor Europe, I gained first-hand experience working with large datasets, testing financial controls, and reporting findings to senior stakeholders. I enjoyed the challenge of analysing information under time pressure and identifying insights that influenced decision-making. In addition, my extracurricular roles \u2014 such as managing budgets and securing funding as Treasurer of the UEA Golf Club \u2014 strengthened my ability to think commercially and make informed financial decisions.

      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me about this Graduate position is the combination of early responsibility, structured development, and the chance to contribute to a sector that is both commercially challenging and socially important. The rotational nature of the programme really appeals to me because it means I won\u2019t just be confined to one area \u2014 I\u2019ll be able to experience different parts of the business, broaden my perspective, and build a more rounded commercial skill set before deciding where I can make the biggest impact.\nWhat also makes this position stand out is the balance between analysis and collaboration. I enjoy working with data and identifying insights, but I also enjoy the people side \u2014 presenting findings, influencing decisions, and working with colleagues to solve problems. During my placement at Honda Motor Europe, for example, I carried out financial control testing but also worked closely with stakeholders across multiple regions to explain results and recommend improvements. Having that mix of technical and interpersonal challenge is something I value, and I see the same in this role.\nFinally, what excites me most is the opportunity to develop within EDF, an organisation that is central to the UK\u2019s energy future. Being able to grow as a commercial professional while contributing to projects that help drive the transition to net zero makes this graduate programme feel both professionally rewarding and personally meaningful."

These experiences have already given me a taste of how different teams interact to support trading activities, from managing trade flows to assessing and mitigating market risks.\n\nAt EDF Trading, I am particularly motivated by the prospect of applying and expanding this experience in an international and fast-paced environment, learning from specialists across multiple desks, and ultimately building the foundations to contribute meaningfully to the company\u2019s commercial performance.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "As a French national with a strong interest in global energy markets, I am naturally drawn to EDF Trading\u2019s position as a leading player in European energy and environmental products, backed by the strength and reputation of the EDF Group. The company\u2019s role in optimising the EDF portfolio while managing complex cross-border trading activities particularly appeals to me, as it combines commercial excellence with strategic importance in the energy transition.\n\nHaving grown up and studied internationally, I value EDF Trading\u2019s multicultural and collaborative environment, which I see as an ideal setting to apply my skills and broaden my perspective. My current experience in a trading house, where I rotate between functions, has reinforced my desire to work in an organisation where these activities are seamlessly integrated to drive performance. EDF Trading offers the perfect platform to develop my expertise while contributing to a business at the heart of the European energy landscape.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me most about this Graduate position is the opportunity to gain structured, hands-on exposure to multiple areas of the trading business through four diverse six-month rotations. I value the opportunity to work across various desks, including trading, market risk, analytics, and origination.\n\nI am particularly attracted to the way this programme combines real responsibility from day one with mentorship, technical training, and a collaborative trading-floor environment. The ability to develop a broad commercial perspective while building specialist knowledge is, to me, the ideal foundation for a long-term career in energy markets, especially within a market leader like EDF Trading."

      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it is a company that combines technical expertise, innovation, and a forward-thinking approach to energy markets. What excites me most is the way EDF Trading operates at the intersection of markets, regulation, and geopolitics. Energy trading is not only about understanding supply and demand, but also about anticipating how policy changes, regulatory developments, and geopolitical events can impact markets. That dynamic aspect of the industry is something I find particularly fascinating, and it aligns perfectly with my studies in Politics at Newcastle University, where I have explored how legislation and international developments shape economic and market outcomes.\nI am also drawn to EDF Trading\u2019s culture of challenging traditional ideas and fostering innovation. The company encourages creative thinking and entrepreneurship, which is the kind of environment in which I thrive. My internship at Barclays gave me hands-on experience in regulatory assessments, compliance analysis, and performance analytics, allowing me to see how careful evaluation of rules, frameworks, and risk can have a real impact on business decisions.

      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What really stands out to me about this graduate position at EDF Trading is the opportunity to experience the energy trading industry in a structured and hands-on way. The two-year rotational programme is particularly appealing because it allows graduates to explore different areas of the business, from trading and analytics to market risk and origination. I see this as a unique chance to develop a broad understanding of the energy markets while also identifying the areas where I can contribute most effectively and continue to grow professionally. I am drawn to the idea of working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment where curiosity, analytical thinking, and commercial awareness are highly valued.\nMy experience as a Barclays summer intern has given me a strong foundation in many of the skills that I believe are essential for this programme. At Barclays, I worked on performance analytics and financial modelling for over 5,000 colleagues, producing actionable insights to improve customer experience and deliver cost-efficiency initiatives. I also conducted regulatory risk assessments and FCA-aligned compliance research, presenting my findings to key stakeholders. This experience taught me how to analyse complex data, think critically about risk and compliance, and communicate findings clearly to different audiences. Additionally, developing a leadership training programme for over 120 managers required project planning, coordination, and stakeholder management, which helped me understand the importance of aligning strategy, people, and operational objectives. Shadowing teams across Incident Management, Wealth Management, and Regulations further exposed me to regulatory frameworks and operational decision-making, which I can see being highly relevant to understanding the regulatory and policy context of the energy markets.\nStudying Politics at Newcastle University has also provided me with a unique perspective that I can bring to a role in energy trading. Through modules such as Political Economy and Economic Analysis, I have developed strong quantitative and qualitative analytical skills and learned how to interpret and evaluate complex data sets. At the same time, studying political systems, policy-making, and geopolitics has given me an appreciation of how legislation, government decisions, and international developments can shape markets. I believe this combination of analytical skills and understanding of regulatory and political frameworks is particularly relevant to the energy sector, where market movements are often influenced by policy changes and geopolitical events.\nWhat excites me most about this role is the opportunity to combine these skills in a commercial setting. EDF Trading\u2019s focus on innovation, collaboration, and high performance aligns with the environments I have thrived in during my internships and leadership roles at school and sixth form. I am motivated by the challenge of working on complex problems and contributing to projects that have a tangible impact. I also value the structured training, mentorship, and exposure to senior leaders that the programme offers, as I see them as crucial for developing the technical expertise, commercial understanding, and professional skills needed to succeed in energy trading.\nOverall, this graduate programme stands out to me because it offers a unique combination of learning, practical experience, and exposure to a dynamic global market. I am particularly excited about the chance to build a career in energy trading, applying both the analytical skills I have developed through my studies and internships and my understanding of legislation, policy, and geopolitics. The role represents a perfect opportunity to grow professionally, contribute meaningfully to the business, and gain insight into a sector that plays a critical role in global energy security and sustainability."

      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it offers the opportunity to be at the centre of the global energy transition, combining commercial innovation with a commitment to low-carbon solutions. The company\u2019s strong presence in the European power and gas markets, backed by the scale and purpose of the EDF Group, presents a unique environment to develop both technical and strategic skills. I\u2019m particularly drawn to the rotational structure of the graduate programme, which will allow me to explore different areas of trading and risk, while learning directly from market experts. EDFT\u2019s emphasis on collaboration, respect, and diversity also strongly aligns with the team-focused environments I\u2019ve thrived in\u2014whether that\u2019s at Barclays, in political internships, or in leadership roles. With my interest in global affairs and markets, EDF Trading is the ideal place to begin a career that\u2019s both intellectually challenging and globally relevant.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What makes me stand out is the intersection of analytical experience, leadership in high-pressure environments, and a strong academic foundation in politics and economics, which gives me a unique and relevant perspective on the global energy landscape.\nAs a Politics undergraduate, I\u2019ve studied political economy, economic data analysis, and macroeconomic theory, which has given me a deep understanding of the structural forces driving energy markets \u2013 from regulatory shifts and economic cycles to geopolitical tensions. In today's volatile environment, where trading decisions are heavily influenced by global events \u2013 whether that\u2019s OPEC decisions, LNG flows, or regional conflicts \u2013 this perspective is not just relevant, it\u2019s essential.\nMy academic background equips me to interpret how political and regulatory developments affect market dynamics. For example, understanding the implications of sanctions, EU climate policy, or changes in central bank interest rates enhances my ability to anticipate risk and opportunity \u2014 something that\u2019s highly valuable on the trading floor.\nCombined with my recent work in performance analytics and regulatory risk at Barclays, as well as stakeholder-facing roles in Parliament and customer-focused leadership at The Bower Caf\u00e9, I bring a well-rounded skill set: commercial awareness, geopolitical insight, and strong communication.\nThis blend of political and economic literacy, combined with hands-on experience in data-driven environments, means I can bring a broader, more strategic lens to commercial decision-making \u2014 and that\u2019s what will make me stand out at EDF Trading."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "Perfect! Here's a strong answer for What is your understanding of this role based on the job description? that showcases your analytical thinking:\n\nMy Understanding of the EDF Trading Commercial Graduate Programme:\nBased on the job description, I understand this to be a comprehensive 2-year development programme designed to build expertise across all facets of wholesale energy trading. The role offers four 6-month rotations spanning Energy Commodities Trading, Market Risk, Analytics, Quant Risk, and Origination, providing deep exposure to both the commercial and technical aspects of energy markets.\nWhat particularly excites me is the combination of quantitative analysis and commercial application. The programme balances hands-on trading floor experience with structured learning, allowing graduates to develop critical thinking skills while working on real business projects that impact EDFT's market position. The rotational structure ensures broad exposure to different career paths within energy trading, from direct market participation to risk management and client origination.\nI'm drawn to the analytical components - using programming skills to develop pricing models, conducting market research, and performing risk assessments that support trading decisions. Having worked with financial markets analysis and derivatives exposure assessment at TFCL, I understand how quantitative analysis drives commercial success in fast-paced trading environments.\nThe role also emphasizes building networks across EDFT's global operations and regular interaction with commercial teams and leaders, which aligns perfectly with my stakeholder management experience and interest in collaborative, high-performing environments.\nUltimately, I see this as an opportunity to apply my analytical and programming skills to solve complex market challenges while developing commercial expertise in the critical energy sector that's central to the green transition.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "EDF Trading represents the perfect intersection of my analytical interests and my desire to contribute to meaningful global challenges. As part of the EDF Group, EDFT is at the forefront of the energy transition - helping shape markets that are fundamental to achieving net-zero goals and energy security. This mission resonates deeply with my interest in sustainable finance and using analytical skills for positive impact.\nFrom a professional perspective, EDFT's position as a specialist in wholesale energy markets offers unparalleled learning opportunities. The company's reach across European power and gas markets, combined with its physical and financial market presence, provides exposure to complex trading strategies and risk management that would accelerate my development as a commercial analyst. Working with both EDF Group assets and third-party customers would give me insight into diverse market dynamics and client relationships.\nWhat particularly attracts me is EDFT's culture of innovation and adaptability. The energy markets are rapidly evolving with renewable integration, regulatory changes, and technological advancement - requiring exactly the kind of flexible, analytical thinking I've developed through my quantitative modeling work at TFCL and commercial analysis at Zedex. The company's emphasis on respect, collaboration, and encouraging employees to speak up aligns with my experience working across diverse, high-performing teams.\nThe rotational programme structure is ideal for someone with my analytical background who wants to understand how quantitative skills apply across trading, risk management, and origination. Having worked with derivatives analysis and market research, I'm excited to apply these skills in the dynamic energy commodities environment where every decision has immediate market impact.\nUltimately, EDF Trading offers the opportunity to build expertise in a sector that's critical for our future while working alongside innovative professionals who are literally powering the energy transition.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What truly sets this programme apart is the rotational structure across four distinct areas - Energy Commodities Trading, Market Risk, Analytics, Quant Risk, and Origination. Unlike traditional graduate schemes that focus on one department, this gives me comprehensive exposure to how energy markets operate from multiple perspectives. Having worked with derivatives analysis at TFCL, I understand how interconnected these functions are, and the opportunity to experience each rotation will build a holistic understanding that's rare in graduate programmes.\nThe hands-on trading floor environment is particularly compelling. Rather than being relegated to back-office analysis, this programme places graduates directly in the commercial heart of energy markets where decisions have immediate impact. The combination of real business projects with structured training means I'll be contributing meaningfully while developing specialized expertise in one of the most dynamic and important sectors.\nWhat also stands out is the analytical and programming focus. Many graduate programmes treat technical skills as secondary, but EDF Trading actively seeks candidates with programming knowledge and quantitative capabilities. This aligns perfectly with my SQL and Python experience - I can see immediate applications for automation, risk modeling, and market analysis that would add value from day one.\nThe global networking opportunities and regular interaction with commercial teams and leaders is exceptional. Building relationships across EDFT's international operations while working directly with experienced traders and risk managers would create a professional network that extends far beyond typical graduate programmes.\nFinally, the clear career progression - with previous graduates becoming junior traders, analysts, and market risk specialists - shows this isn't just a training programme but a genuine pathway to senior roles in energy markets. The two-year timeframe strikes the perfect balance between comprehensive development and meaningful responsibility.\nThis programme uniquely combines technical rigor, commercial application, and global exposure in a sector that's absolutely critical for the future."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "The EDF Commercial Graduate Programme is a rotational, two-year scheme designed to develop commercially minded graduates into future leaders in the UK\u2019s low-carbon energy sector. It offers structured placements across key business areas such as trading, market analysis, digital customer strategy, and commercial risk. Each rotation provides an opportunity to work on high-impact projects that directly contribute to EDF\u2019s mission of helping Britain achieve Net Zero by 2050. This includes analysing market trends, developing pricing models, improving customer engagement through digital platforms, and supporting the delivery of low-carbon solutions.\n\nWhat makes the role particularly compelling is the combination of commercial rigour and purpose-driven impact. Graduates are expected not only to build technical and strategic skills\u2014such as risk evaluation, stakeholder collaboration, and financial modelling\u2014but also to apply them in the context of decarbonisation, customer empowerment, and innovation. The programme is structured to develop both analytical ability and leadership potential, with strong mentorship and support from experienced professionals across EDF\u2019s commercial teams.\n\nThe job description also highlights EDF\u2019s commitment to flexibility, inclusion, and personal development. With hybrid working and placements across various UK sites, the role offers both professional exposure and adaptability. It is clear that EDF is looking for candidates who are not only numerate and commercially aware, but who are also passionate about shaping the future of energy and contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable future for the UK.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "My interest in EDF Trading stems from its unique position as one of Europe\u2019s leading energy market participants, actively shaping the commercial dynamics of the energy transition. Unlike traditional trading desks focused purely on arbitrage or speculation, EDF Trading plays a strategic role in supporting the EDF Group's broader Net Zero objectives by managing market volatility, balancing generation portfolios, and enabling cross-border energy flows. What sets EDF Trading apart is its direct involvement in projects that are transforming how low-carbon energy is priced, transported, and delivered in real-time energy systems.\n\nFor example, EDF Trading has been instrumental in developing cross-border power trading strategies that support renewables integration across markets like the UK, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. Their role in enabling flexibility trading on the UK\u2019s National Grid and Continental Europe\u2019s balancing markets, especially during high wind or solar generation periods, demonstrates a nuanced understanding of how to commercialise intermittency\u2014an area I\u2019m academically and professionally invested in. Additionally, EDFT\u2019s investment in LNG optimization, particularly the management of regasification terminals and flexible cargo contracts, shows their ability to integrate traditional trading with the emerging low-carbon value chain. These are real-world commercial puzzles that align closely with my interest in pricing, infrastructure finance, and decarbonisation logistics.\n\nWith prior experience modelling energy infrastructure deals and clean-tech investment proposals, I am drawn to the analytical sophistication and operational scale that EDF Trading brings to energy markets. It\u2019s not just about financial returns, it\u2019s about shaping market mechanisms that allow clean energy to scale. The opportunity to work at the heart of this transformation, where trading strategy meets energy policy and decarbonisation, is exactly the kind of intellectually challenging, impact-driven environment I\u2019m looking for.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What genuinely sets this programme apart for me is EDF\u2019s unique commercial interface between regulated and deregulated energy markets, and how this graduate role offers exposure to both. EDF operates in highly structured capacity markets such as the UK Capacity Market and French CRM, while simultaneously trading in liberalised power, gas, and carbon markets across Europe. Very few graduate schemes offer the chance to understand how strategic pricing, risk modelling, and customer product innovation are managed within these contrasting market frameworks.\n\nThis dual exposure is especially compelling when viewed in light of EDF\u2019s recent focus on digitalisation in retail and customer operations, particularly through EDF UK's smart meter-driven analytics and the use of customer consumption data to shape flexible tariff design. The fact that commercial graduates may get to work on projects that bridge regulatory economics, customer behaviour modelling, and commercial strategy is exciting\u2014not because it\u2019s trendy, but because it reflects the complexity of real-world decarbonisation economics.\n\nI\u2019m particularly intrigued by EDF's recent work with demand-side flexibility pilots, such as their involvement in Power Responsive with National Grid and trials with Octopus Energy on time-of-use pricing. These aren\u2019t just pilot projects, they\u2019re signals that EDF is thinking several steps ahead, developing scalable commercial frameworks that make customer-side decarbonisation profitable and system-relevant.\n\nFor someone who has worked on cost modelling in clean-tech investments and is academically grounded in both econometrics and corporate finance, the opportunity to build commercial frameworks that sit at the intersection of consumer behaviour, policy constraints, and real-time energy markets is what truly sets this programme apart."

      "Are you available from September 2026?": "Yes",
      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "This role develops graduates into commercially capable analysts who can contribute to both trading and customer-facing decisions. It is not just a rotational scheme, but a chance to take responsibility for projects that affect EDF\u2019s market positioning and its ability to support Net Zero. Analysts are expected to combine data analysis with commercial judgement, moving between market fundamentals, trading decisions, and customer solutions.\n\nI see the role as demanding because it requires quick mastery of new systems, precision under pressure, and the ability to translate market signals into actionable recommendations. Trading placements will involve exposure to power, gas, and carbon markets, where understanding supply-demand balances and policy shocks is essential. Customer-facing placements will focus on creating solutions that lower emissions and improve efficiency, which requires linking technical modelling with commercial delivery.\n\nWhat stands out is the expectation that graduates deliver measurable impact. The programme gives training, but success depends on how quickly you can apply it to real problems. For me, this is exactly the kind of challenge I want: an environment that combines analytical rigour, commercial intensity, and the responsibility to support decisions that matter to both markets and customers.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it operates at the point where energy markets, risk management, and decarbonisation converge. Trading here is not only about optimising positions, but about supporting the integration of renewables and delivering on Net Zero. That combination of commercial intensity and strategic purpose is rare, and it matches my own motivation.\n\nMy academic work has focused on energy transition economics and quantitative modelling. At Imperial I analysed carbon pricing, hydrogen adoption, and regulatory risk, while at Bayes I focused on corporate governance and financial modelling. Professionally, I applied this training in consulting and analytics roles. I built compliance and cost models for shipping clients, automated ETL pipelines that improved risk visibility, and created forecasting tools that strengthened cash-flow analysis. These experiences taught me how to handle complex datasets, work under pressure, and deliver insights that shape decisions.\n\nEDF Trading stands out because it combines the scale of a global portfolio with the agility of a trading house. That environment rewards precision, resilience, and speed. I see myself thriving here, contributing to market analysis, risk modelling, and customer strategy while building the expertise to take on greater responsibility in trading.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What makes this programme unique is the mix of breadth and accountability. The rotations cover trading, customer strategy, and digital channels, but each placement carries real responsibility. That balance of variety and ownership is exactly what I am looking for.\n\nThe trading exposure is particularly appealing. Working directly on market analysis and risk assessment means decisions I contribute to will have immediate consequences. That pressure motivates me. My past experience has shown I perform best when accuracy and speed are critical. Whether it was building decarbonisation cost models under tight deadlines or automating reporting pipelines that reduced cycle times by 30 percent, I learned how to deliver precise outputs under pressure.\n\nI am also motivated by the direct link to Net Zero. This programme is not just about learning trading mechanics, but about applying them in a way that accelerates the energy transition. Knowing that my work would support both EDF\u2019s portfolio and national climate goals makes the role distinctive.\n\nFinally, the culture stands out. EDF Trading combines global scale with entrepreneurial decision-making. That blend creates an environment where graduates are trusted to contribute early, and where I can develop into someone capable of handling risk and capturing opportunity in volatile markets."

The structure of four six-month rotations appeals to me because it gives the chance to experience different perspectives\u2014whether that\u2019s trading, analytics, risk, or origination\u2014before deciding on a longer-term career path.\n\nFrom what I understand, the programme is designed to build both technical and commercial skills in a very hands-on way. It\u2019s not just about learning theory, but about contributing to real projects, developing analytical tools, understanding how market risk is managed, and building relationships across teams. I think the emphasis on agility, critical thinking, and innovation fits closely with my background, particularly from my current role at ADM where I\u2019ve worked on live PnLs, basis grids, and vessel operations, as well as my time at Clarksons where I built predictive freight models and automated data pipelines.\n\nI also take from the description that the culture is an important part of the programme\u2014EDF Trading values diversity, respect, and encouraging people to speak up. That resonates with me because in my previous teams I\u2019ve seen how much stronger decisions are when people bring different experiences and ideas to the table.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it combines two things that really motivate me: being at the centre of global energy markets and working in an environment that values innovation and critical thinking. I\u2019ve had a strong interest in energy and commodities since my time at Clarksons, where I focused on freight and shipping markets, and more recently at ADM, where I rotated through trading desks and worked on projects like live PnLs and basis grids. Those experiences gave me a feel for how dynamic and fast-moving markets can be, and I want to build on that in a setting that is even more commercially focused.\n\nEDF Trading stands out because of its scale and diversity. The mix of commodities you\u2019re involved in\u2014power, gas, LNG, oil, and environmental products\u2014means there\u2019s always something new to learn and opportunities to think creatively about market connections. I\u2019m also drawn to the culture that EDFT describes. The emphasis on respect, diversity, and encouraging people to challenge ideas is important to me. I\u2019ve seen how effective teams become when people are free to share perspectives, and that\u2019s the kind of environment I want to be part of.\n\nFinally, EDF Trading is part of a global leader in low-carbon energy. The energy transition is the biggest structural change in markets right now, and being part of a company that plays a leading role in shaping that future is something I find genuinely exciting.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What really stands out to me about this graduate position is the structure of the four six-month rotations. I like the idea of being able to experience different parts of the business\u2014whether that\u2019s trading, risk, analytics, or origination\u2014because it gives me the chance to build a broad foundation and understand where I can make the biggest impact.\n\nI\u2019m also motivated by the fact that this programme gives you the opportunity to prove yourself. You\u2019re trusted to take on real responsibilities from the start, and I see that as a great way to develop both technically and commercially.\n\nFinally, I value that the pathways from the programme into junior trading roles and other commercial positions are clearly viable. For me, that makes this more than just a graduate scheme\u2014it\u2019s a genuine launchpad for a long-term career in energy markets."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "I understand this to be a two\u2011year, fixed\u2011term Commercial Graduate programme based at EDF Trading\u2019s London headquarters, giving broad, front\u2011office exposure to the energy trading business. \n\nThe programme is structured around four six\u2011month rotations that encompasses the following areas: Energy Commodities Trading, Market Risk, Analytics, Quant Risk, and Origination. Across these rotations, the aim is to build a deep, practical understanding of how EDF Trading operates and how value is created and protected across the wholesale markets for power, gas, LNG, LPG, oil and environmental products in a fast\u2011moving, agile environment. \n\nThe two years of training culminates in a strong platform for permanent roles in EDF Trading such as being a junior trader, analyst or market risk analyst.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "EDF Trading sits at the intersection of asset\u2011backed trading and the low\u2011carbon transition. As part of the EDF Group, the firm pairs real physical assets and market depth with disciplined risk management, creating a setting where analytical insight directly translates into tangible value. EDF also has a global presence across London, Paris, Singapore and Houston; all the above paired with an inclusive culture and the mandate to manage and hedge real risks for EDF Group and its customers makes EDF Trading the place where I see myself growing quickly and making a meaningful contribution.\n\nThat conviction was reinforced at the AmplifyME\u2011partnered event, where I heard from CFO Sylvie Billion, the recruitment team and recent graduates. The aspect that stood out to me most was that all teams and operations were carried out on a single trading floor. This, combined with a flat structure, paves the way for clear transparency and accessibility across teams and experience levels. I believe that this is a culture where creativity and innovation can occur; by asking informed questions at source and getting rapid feedback, ideas can be iterated quickly and relentlessly  alongside experienced professionals. I also feel a strong personal fit with the work; I ranked first out of 80 in my group in the energy trading simulation and also enjoyed the quant coding challenge on moving averages, reflecting the blend of market intuition, data literacy and coding I\u2019m keen to apply at EDF Trading.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out is the programme\u2019s blend of rotational breadth and genuine front\u2011office proximity, which builds the full trade lifecycle understanding early and lets me add value on live projects while discovering where I\u2019m strongest. Its explicit aim of making graduates desk\u2011ready, reinforced by recent graduates\u2019 feedback that junior traders are trusted to manage positions, signals meaningful responsibility and autonomy, underpinned by strong mentorship and controls.\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m drawn towards the energy trading rotations; tasks such as interpreting fundamentals, tracking spreads and volatility, shaping trade ideas, executing and hedging with disciplined risk\u2011taking under time pressure makes this a fast paced environment where every day is different. Coupled with the one\u2011floor setup, structured training and ongoing coaching from experienced professionals,  this programme is the ideal environment to accelerate into a high\u2011impact junior trader role.\n\nThe above being said, I do firmly believe in keeping an open mind going into this program. I do plan to use the rotations to build a rounded commercial toolkit across analytics, quant/market risk and origination, and to let performance, feedback and business need guide where I ultimately add the most value, whether that\u2019s a trading desk or an analytical/risk role. That flexibility, combined with the programme\u2019s breadth and support, is what makes it so compelling."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "My understanding is that the two-year graduate programme is designed to give a well-rounded understanding of the energy trading industry through four rotations at EDF Trading. The areas I would work in could be energy commodities trading, analytics, market risk, quant risk, and origination, where I would gain both a commercial and analytical perspective on how EDF operates in the physical and financial energy markets. For example, a trader rotation at EDF may involve buying and selling commodities (e.g. power or gas) and using financial instruments (e.g. options) to hedge against price volatility and manage risk. The programme combines hands-on trading experience with the development of technical, quantitative, and risk management skills needed to succeed in a fast-paced, data-driven trading floor.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I took an environmental physics course that showed me how different energy sources work and the fundamentals behind them, which sparked a lasting interest in how energy is produced, priced, transported and used. EDF Trading\u2019s graduate programme offers me the opportunity to develop my knowledge of the energy sector within one of Europe\u2019s largest and most diverse energy trading organisations. I am particularly impressed by how EDF is expanding into renewables and supporting global efforts to achieve net zero by 2050, and I want to contribute to that transition through trading and risk management. I also value how EDF is constantly integrating and optimising the use of technology and data in energy solutions, which aligns closely with my mathematical, coding, and analytical skills. This combination of technological innovation and commitment to decarbonisation makes EDF Trading a company I am highly motivated to learn from and contribute to.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What makes this graduate position stand out is the range of experience offered through four rotations across energy commodities trading, risk, analytics, and origination. Unlike other positions within the energy trading sector, this programme provides wide exposure to both the commercial and quantitative aspects of trading, from market execution to developing models and managing risk. This structure particularly appeals to me because it offers a clear way to apply my problem-solving, mathematical, and quantitative skills within the energy sector. For example, I would bring my strong coding ability to the EDF Trading team, whether modelling or executing trading strategies, employing data science techniques to identify market patterns, or using machine learning to support analysis and execution. As captain of my university football team, I learnt to communicate clearly, listen, and make decisions under pressure, and I look forward to applying this teamwork ability across a diverse range of teams on the trading floor. I am eager to continue developing my skills while learning from experienced traders and analysts at EDF Trading."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "From what I understand, the EDF Trading Commercial Graduate Programme is a two-year rotational scheme where graduates spend six months in each of four different areas, like power and gas trading, derivatives, origination, analytics, and risk. Essentially, it\u2019s designed to give you a broad view of how energy markets work, both in terms of physical supply and financial trading. At the same time, each rotation lets you dig deeper into real projects, whether that\u2019s analysing market trends, building models, assessing risks, or structuring deals. The role also requires using data and analysis to make informed decisions, while being aware of the bigger commercial picture and understanding which risks are acceptable. EDF Trading\u2019s mix of physical markets, commodities, and environmental products means you need to be able to see both the operational and financial sides of energy. Overall, it\u2019s a programme for someone, like myself, who wants to learn all aspects of energy markets, make meaningful contributions using analytical skills, take ownership of their work, and thrive in a fast-moving, constantly changing environment",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "My interest in EDF Trading grew naturally from following the energy sector and seeing how it directly affects everyday life, from household energy bills to the competitiveness of factories and the reliability of electricity for communities. Energy markets aren\u2019t abstract; they have a tangible impact on people and businesses alike, and EDF Trading sits at the intersection of trading, risk, optimisation, and sustainability. The firm\u2019s asset-backed and global operations, covering everything from wholesale power and gas to oil and environmental products, provide both scale and stability. I am particularly drawn to the way EDF Trading invests in data, automation, and analytics, which aligns with my own experience in building models, performing sensitivity analyses, and generating actionable insights. Beyond technical excellence, the company\u2019s mission and culture, as part of the EDF Group with a clear net zero ambition, demonstrates that it values making a meaningful contribution to a sustainable energy future. Finally, the rotational structure of the programme, allowing exposure across trading, risk, origination, and analytics, mirrors the variety of experiences I have already had and provides an integrated platform to develop a holistic understanding of the energy sector. EDF Trading appeals to me because it combines impact, complexity, quantitative challenge, and purpose in a company shaping the future of energy",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me most about this Programme is that it is not just a foot in the door but a structured journey of growth, responsibility, and contribution. From a young age, I remember watching energy bills spike or hearing news about shortages and thinking someone must understand both the numbers and their real-world impact. That curiosity led me to study economics and politics, then into internships where I worked on financial statements, stress tests, risk reviews, and investment analysis. Each experience taught me that success comes not from excelling at one isolated task, but from understanding how market movements, regulation, data, and risk connect and affect real people, companies, and communities. The rotational structure of this programme is particularly compelling because it allows me to gain a holistic view of how markets behave, how risk is managed, how deals are structured, and how analytics supports decision-making. EDF Trading offers real-world responsibility; it is clear from the programme description that graduates work on projects that influence client outcomes, optimise flows, and apply scenario modelling. The structured mentorship and exposure across teams create a learning environment where I can experiment, receive feedback, and grow. Energy is a field that matters to everyone\u2019s daily life home heating, sustainable power, and supply resilience so knowing that my work can help reduce carbon risk, provide reliable power, and improve market efficiency is deeply motivating. I bring experience in financial analysis, modelling, stress testing, and risk evaluation, and I thrive in fast-moving, ambiguous environments where careful judgment is required. I aim to contribute from day one by applying my analytical skills, attention to detail, and understanding of markets while using this programme to develop strong technical fluency and sound judgment, learning when to accept risk, hedge, or act boldly in a way that aligns with EDF Trading\u2019s values and mission."

The opportunity to contribute meaningfully from the outset, while receiving structured training and mentorship, is particularly appealing.\n\nFinally, the role\u2019s alignment with the energy transition makes it especially compelling. Being part of a company that is not only a major player in global energy markets but also focused on developing innovative solutions for sustainability is both exciting and motivating."

My work included analysing energy demand and intensity trends across regions and estimating household energy expenditures, particularly for low-income households, to assess the redistributive impacts of public measures.\n\nThese experiences gave me strong technical and analytical skills, and a solid understanding of both microeconomic and macroeconomic dimensions of energy and climate policies. What excites me about EDF Trading is the chance to apply this knowledge in a new context \u2014 market-driven and international \u2014 where I can complement my background in policy analysis with practical exposure to trading, risk and market analytics. I see it as the ideal next step to broaden my perspective and grow into a versatile energy professional.\nI am also drawn to the structure of the graduate programme itself: the opportunity to rotate across trading, risk, analytics and origination is rare, and it will allow me to develop a broad and solid foundation in the energy markets before specialising. Finally, EDFT\u2019s international environment and its culture of innovation and diversity are very appealing to me. I want to grow in a company that is both high-performing and committed to inclusion, and EDF Trading represents exactly that."

EDF Trading\u2019s position at the heart of European and global energy markets particularly appeals to me, from power and gas trading to supporting the integration of renewables. With my academic background in History and Economics, I bring a strong analytical foundation to understand the dynamics of energy markets. In particular through my studies of European economic history, I became fascinated with the importance and opportunities assosciated with the energy sector. In addition, my European heritage and ability to speak Portuguese, Spanish and French would allow me to operate effectively in EDF\u2019s international environment, working across borders to support collaboration and commercial growth. This role represents an ideal way for me to apply my skills and experiences to a business that is central to enabling the low-carbon future.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me about this Graduate position is the unique combination of structured development and meaningful impact. The four six-month rotations across trading, digital strategy, market analysis and customer channels offer the chance to build a broad skill set while working on projects that directly support Britain\u2019s journey to Net Zero. Having seen during my internship at National Grid how financial modelling and ESG benchmarking underpin the energy transition, I am particularly excited by the opportunity to contribute to EDF\u2019s landmark projects, such as Hinkley Point C, as well as its expansion in renewables.\n\nWhat also makes this role distinctive is EDF\u2019s culture. The focus on collaboration, innovation and inclusivity, alongside the belief that 'Success is Personal' resonates strongly with me. I am motivated by environments where I can learn from experts, bring fresh ideas, work across international teams and where I can utilise my linguistic abiilities in an international context. This programme stands out because it is not just about developing technical expertise but also it is about becoming part of a company that is reshaping the energy landscape and giving graduates the responsibility and support to make a tangible impact within the European energy transition."

      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "As a French student, it would be a real pleasure to work for a French company with such a strong international presence. EDF is not only a leader in low-carbon energy, but also represents stability, innovation, and ambition at a global scale. I am passionate about finance and eager to learn within a big company where I can see the real impact of my work.

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "This role is a two-year graduate programme designed to build strong trading expertise within EDF\u2019s Customers business unit. It begins with an initial eight-month placement on the Shift Trading desk, where graduates are trained and authorised to trade in real time. The main responsibility is to optimise EDF\u2019s large zero-carbon generation portfolio \u2014 including nuclear, renewables and batteries \u2014 in a 24/7 environment, balancing automation, algorithms and human decision-making.\n\nAfter becoming authorised, the programme offers a series of rotations across areas such as market analysis, market risk, compliance, portfolio analytics, pricing and reporting. These placements provide a broader perspective on how trading activities connect with risk management and the wider energy markets. The final months are spent back on the Shift Trading desk to either consolidate the experience or progress further as an authorised trader. Overall, the programme combines hands-on trading exposure with analytical development, preparing graduates for future roles such as trader, analyst or risk specialist within EDF Trading.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because I strongly identify with its values of responsibility, innovation, and collaboration. EDF plays a unique role in the energy transition, operating the UK\u2019s largest zero-carbon generation portfolio and leading the development of sustainable trading solutions. Joining the graduate programme is an opportunity to contribute directly to this mission while learning in a highly international and diverse environment.\n\nWhat particularly resonates with me is the balance between technical excellence and responsibility toward society. At Valeo, for instance, I worked on risk management in a highly regulated environment, where attention to detail and accountability were essential to maintain safety and quality standards. Later, at Auris Gestion, I contributed to investment fund analysis, where collaboration and rigorous debate in committees were key to sound decision-making. In both cases, I experienced how responsibility, teamwork, and innovation can make a tangible difference.\n\nFor me, EDF Trading represents the chance to apply these principles at the heart of the energy markets, in a role that combines analytical rigour with a broader purpose: helping to shape a sustainable, low-carbon future.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What makes this Graduate position stand out to me is the way it mirrors the journey I have taken so far. I began by training as an engineer at Arts et M\u00e9tiers, driven by a curiosity to understand how energy is produced, transmitted, and optimised in real systems. This gave me not only a technical grounding in energy systems but also the habit of thinking in terms of constraints, efficiency and innovation. Wanting to complement this with a broader perspective, I pursued the MSc 272 at Dauphine, where I immersed myself in market finance, derivatives and risk management, learning how financial decisions shape entire industries.\n\nAlong this path, I came to realise that energy trading is the natural intersection of these two worlds: it requires both the ability to grasp the physical realities of power generation and the agility to respond to financial signals in fast-moving markets. For me, this graduate programme embodies that balance. It offers the chance to use my dual background in engineering and finance in a context where technical insight and market understanding are not separate, but rather work hand in hand to create value and support the energy transition."

      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "There are three aspects that ultimately attracted me most to EDF: the company\u2019s industry-leading role in zero-carbon electricity and the energy transition, its commitment to developing future leaders through hands-on rotations and targeted training, and the inclusive culture that celebrates teamwork, diversity, and professional growth. After researching EDF\u2019s Commercial Graduate Programme, I am impressed by the opportunity to gain experience across commercial strategy, market analysis, trading, and customer engagement, all while contributing to Britain\u2019s journey to Net Zero through innovation and collaboration.\n\nAs a detail-oriented individual with a background in finance and energy, I have developed robust analytical and data management skills through internships as a Risk Analyst and Data Analyst. My work at Tricon Energy involved assessing exposure and liquidity in derivative markets, which taught me the rigor and strategic insight crucial for commercial roles. At NTT Data, I built Python-based tools and worked across teams to deliver business-critical insights, directly supporting project leadership and commercial decision-making.\n\nParticipation in trading competitions, hackathons, and semi-professional football has reinforced my resilience, adaptability, and ability to work collaboratively, skills that I am eager to bring to EDF\u2019s dynamic graduate programme.

At Tricon Energy, I learned the importance of managing both risks and opportunities to support traders, something I\u2019m eager to develop further here. My background in football, competing against players who now perform at the professional level, shaped my discipline, resilience, and competitive mindset. On top of that, I\u2019ve built algorithms to identify inefficiencies in sports markets, which sharpened my critical, quantitative, and commercial thinking. This role stands out because it allows me to bring together my experience in risk and analytics with my passion for markets and my drive to grow in a dynamic, high-performance environment."

As the wholesale market arm of the EDF Group, EDF Trading operates across Europe, Asia, and North America, playing a central role in balancing energy systems and managing market risks in increasingly volatile environments. This means the role combines exposure to both the physical side of energy \u2014 including assets like storage, transport, and supply \u2014 and the financial side, where hedging, derivatives, and risk management strategies are critical.\n\nIn practice, the role involves analysing supply and demand fundamentals, monitoring global market trends, and helping to optimise EDF\u2019s physical and contractual positions. Depending on the team, this could mean building and using quantitative models to forecast market movements, supporting trading decisions with data-driven insights, or ensuring operational and risk processes are aligned with the company\u2019s commercial strategy. Because EDF Trading also works with affiliates and third-party clients, strong communication skills and the ability to translate complex market insights into clear recommendations are key.\n\nOverall, the role sits at the intersection of markets, data, and energy systems, requiring both technical and commercial awareness. It offers the opportunity to contribute directly to how EDF manages its exposure in volatile energy markets, supports the integration of renewables, and ensures reliable energy supply. Success in the role will require strong analytical and numerical skills, a genuine interest in commodities and energy markets, and the ability to work collaboratively in a fast-paced, high-pressure trading environment.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it offers the unique opportunity to operate at the intersection of physical energy and financial markets.

I see this as an excellent environment to apply my analytical and problem-solving skills, while also learning from experienced professionals in a fast-moving market setting.\n\nMost importantly, I am drawn to EDF Trading\u2019s mission of supporting the wider EDF Group and its affiliates, as well as third-party clients, in navigating increasingly complex energy markets. The company\u2019s focus on both risk management and sustainable energy integration aligns closely with my own values and long-term career goals. Working at EDF Trading would allow me to contribute to meaningful outcomes in energy security and decarbonisation, while developing a career in trading and market analysis within a world-class organisation.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me about this Graduate position is the unique combination of exposure to both the physical energy markets and the financial trading environment. Unlike many graduate schemes that focus narrowly on one area, EDF Trading\u2019s programme offers rotations across trading, analytics, risk, and operations, giving a holistic view of how energy markets function end to end. This breadth of experience is particularly appealing to me because it allows me to develop a wide range of skills while discovering where I can make the greatest impact.\n\nI am also drawn to the international scope of the role. EDF Trading operates across Europe, Asia, and North America, which means graduates are immediately exposed to global market dynamics and the complexities of trading across interconnected regions. This global perspective is exciting because it combines real-world commercial decision-making with the challenge of navigating diverse markets and regulatory environments.\n\nFinally, what differentiates this programme for me is EDF Trading\u2019s role in balancing energy systems and integrating renewables in increasingly volatile markets. The graduate position offers the chance not only to develop technical and analytical expertise but also to contribute to solutions that have a tangible impact on energy transition and sustainability. That blend of commercial challenge and broader purpose is what makes this opportunity stand out above others."

It\u2019s not a back-office role \u2014 you\u2019re right in the mix, working on real projects that help the company deliver clean, affordable energy while moving the UK towards Net Zero.\n\nPractically, that means analysing market data to understand trends and support trading decisions, looking for ways to improve digital customer journeys, and spotting opportunities or risks in how EDF operates commercially. It\u2019s also about collaborating with different teams to shape low-carbon products and services for customers, and even leading small projects yourself to improve customer experience or business performance.\n\nAt its core, the job is about learning how a major energy company makes money and serves its customers, and building the commercial awareness, problem-solving ability and leadership skills to eventually drive that success yourself.",

Through four six-month rotations across areas such as trading, market risk, analytics, quantitative risk and origination, graduates are able to build a strong foundation in how EDFT manages and trades energy commodities.\n\nThe role is hands-on from the start, involving real business projects that develop both technical and commercial skills while building a deep understanding of energy markets. Graduates are supported through formal training, mentoring and regular interaction with senior colleagues, as well as encouraged to contribute their own ideas and perspectives in a fast-moving environment.\n\nFrom my perspective, this programme is about developing future energy market professionals who are analytically strong, commercially minded and adaptable. It requires curiosity, critical thinking and strong interpersonal skills to succeed in the highly dynamic and international trading floor environment. By the end of the programme, graduates are well positioned to progress into roles such as analysts, risk managers or junior traders, contributing to EDFT\u2019s leadership in low-carbon and sustainable energy.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it offers the opportunity to apply my analytical and problem-solving skills in one of the most dynamic and impactful sectors of the global economy. As part of the EDF Group, EDFT plays a leading role in wholesale energy markets while driving the transition to sustainable, low-carbon energy - an area I am motivated to contribute to.\n\nThe Commercial Graduate Programme\u2019s rotational structure particularly excites me. Gaining experience across trading, market risk, analytics and origination would allow me to develop a broad understanding of energy markets while identifying where I can make the most impact. My MSc in Quantitative Finance has given me a strong foundation in stochastic modelling, derivatives pricing and computational finance, and my dissertation on ESG and equity performance reflects my interest in sustainability within financial markets. These skills align well with EDFT\u2019s need for critical thinkers who can interpret data, assess risk and support commercial decisions.\n\nIn addition, my internships at Grant Thornton and Sling Aircraft demonstrate both financial and technical versatility. At Grant Thornton, I built financial forecasting models and conducted market analysis to support investment decisions, while in aerospace R&D I contributed to cross-functional design projects, sharpening my adaptability and collaborative skills. Having studied and worked in the UK, South Africa and Botswana, and being fluent in multiple languages, I also bring an international perspective that fits EDFT\u2019s diverse and global culture.\n\nFor me, EDF Trading is the ideal place to combine my technical expertise, commercial curiosity and global outlook with the chance to contribute to meaningful work in the evolving energy landscape.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me about this Graduate position is the unique combination of breadth, responsibility, and impact it offers. The rotational structure across trading, market risk, analytics and origination is particularly appealing, as it allows me to build a well-rounded understanding of the energy markets while exploring different career paths within a global trading environment. Unlike many graduate schemes, the opportunity to work on real business projects from the outset - while being supported by training, mentoring and regular exposure to senior teams - ensures both rapid learning and meaningful contribution.\n\nI am also drawn to EDF Trading\u2019s role within the wider EDF Group. The chance to contribute to a business that not only leads in wholesale energy trading but also plays a vital role in the global transition to low-carbon energy is exciting and meaningful. Combining this purpose with the fast pace of the trading floor makes the role uniquely attractive.\n\nFinally, the international outlook and collaborative culture of EDFT stand out. Having studied and worked across the UK, South Africa and Botswana, I value diverse perspectives and thrive in cross-cultural teams. The combination of technical challenge, commercial exposure and global impact makes this graduate programme an ideal platform to apply my quantitative finance background, financial modelling experience, and problem-solving skills in a sector that is shaping the future."

      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "My interest in EDF Trading stems from both my professional experience and its unique market position. In my role as a Consultant in commodities, I worked closely with front-office personnel in gas and power who consistently regarded EDFT as a high-performance and truly meritocratic organisation, with a rich and diverse culture. Those starting their careers at the company are given real responsibility to make an impact and shape the energy industry, which is highly motivating.\n\nEDFT has positioned itself at the intersection of physical energy generation, and financial market optimisation. For example, the company's connection to nuclear and hydro assets provides an excellent platform for trading, market insight and risk management. The company continues to expand into exciting new areas, for example the recent expansion of its JV with JERA into Japanese power trading. There is also a clear commitment to sustainability, with a $2.25bn green bond issuance in April 2025 to finance projects aligned with its Green Financing Framework. \n\nEDFT's ability to integrate its physical assets with trading agility sets it apart from pure financial players. This combination of scale, innovation, long-term stability and future-focused culture is an environment where I would wish to develop, and contribute my skills to support the company going forward.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "There are three key aspects that attract me to this position.\n\nThe first is the breadth of rotations. As someone who is keen to hone my skills and contribute in a variety of ways, the chance to work across trading, analytics, risk and origination is very appealing. This will allow me to apply both commercial and analytical skills, whilst building a strong foundation for my career at the company. Importantly, working across several teams will provide wider exposure to the diverse culture the company has clearly built, offering more learning opportunities.\n\nThe second is the role's alignment with my profile. The company is seeking curious, quantitatively strong graduates with excellent interpersonal skills. Through my experience as a Consultant, my interpersonal skills allowed me to build trusted relationships with several stakeholders in the market, from Global Heads of Trading to Graduates. Furthermore, my MSc in Energy, Trade and Finance reflects my passion for the energy industry, and will also allow me to continue to build on my existing quantitative skills in Python and R.\n\nThe third key factor is the company itself and its future-focused strategy. EDFT's role at the centre of European power and gas trading, in conjunction with EDF Group's sustainability commitments and recent initiatives signal that this programme offers a unique platform to grow, in a company that is genuinely shaping the energy transition."

      "What is your understanding of this role based on the job description?": "Based on the job description, my understanding is that the Commercial Graduate Programme at EDF Trading is a rotational scheme designed to cultivate future commercial leaders in the energy markets.\n\nThe core function of the role is to learn how to manage and optimize EDF's portfolio of energy assets and contracts by analysing market fundamentals (supply, demand, weather, geopolitics) to make informed trading, hedging, and risk management decisions. This involves:\n\nAnalytical Rigour: Using quantitative skills to model power prices, analyse gas flow data, or forecast renewable generation to identify trading opportunities and assess risk exposures.\nCommercial Acumen: Understanding the drivers of P&L by learning how to structure deals, price assets, and manage a book within a defined risk framework.\nCross-Functional Collaboration: Rotating through desks such as Power, Gas, LNG, or Origination to gain a holistic view of the wholesale market and how different products interact.\nThis role is not just about executing trades; it's about understanding the entire value chain and using that knowledge to make strategic, commercially astute decisions that enhance the value of EDF's assets and secure energy supply. My MSc thesis, which involved optimising energy deployment using Python, directly aligns with this problem-solving mindset.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "My motivation to join EDF Trading stems from a powerful convergence of my academic focus, my practical skills, and a deep fascination with the strategic complexity of global energy markets.\n\nMy MSc thesis in Financial Engineering involved building Python models to optimise energy deployment, a project that gave me a fundamental appreciation for the critical challenge of balancing renewable intermittency with baseload demand. EDF Trading sits at the very heart of solving this challenge. I am not just interested in trading; I am specifically drawn to the unique role you play in leveraging a vast physical asset base to secure energy supply, manage volatility, and facilitate the energy transition. This is a far more complex and impactful commercial problem than purely financial trading.\n\nFurthermore, your graduate programme\u2019s rotational structure is a significant draw. The opportunity to gain exposure across Power, Gas, and Origination is the ideal way to build the holistic, value-chain understanding required to become a truly effective commercial operator. My experiences on trading desks in Hong Kong, analysing macro risks and building tracking systems, taught me the value of precision and commercial awareness. I am keen to apply that same rigorous, analytical mindset to the physical and financial products within EDF\u2019s portfolio.\n\nUltimately, I want to begin my career at a firm where the commercial decisions are deeply intertwined with tangible, real-world outcomes. EDF Trading\u2019s position as a major integrated energy trader offers an unrivalled opportunity to contribute to energy stability and develop the strategic acumen I am eager to build.",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What truly stands out about this Graduate position is its unique integration of deep analytical rigour with tangible physical asset exposure.\n\nUnlike purely financial trading roles, this programme offers the unparalleled opportunity to understand the entire energy value chain\u2014from generation and logistics to wholesale trading and risk management. The rotational structure is a key differentiator, as it promises a holistic commercial education across desks like Power, Gas, and Origination. This is essential for developing the strategic mindset needed to optimise a complex portfolio of physical and financial products.\n\nFurthermore, the chance to contribute to solving a critical real-world problem\u2014managing energy volatility and supporting the security of supply\u2014provides a level of impact and purpose that I find highly compelling. My MSc thesis focused on optimising energy systems with Python, and I am eager to apply that same problem-solving approach to the sophisticated and commercially vital challenges at the core of EDF Trading's operations."

The programme is designed to provide hands-on exposure to the energy markets, working directly on live business projects while developing both technical and professional skills. It is not just about observing but actively contributing to the trading floor, building a strong foundation in commodities markets, and exploring different career paths within EDF Trading. The emphasis on critical thinking, quantitative and qualitative analysis, and commercial awareness is clear, and I see this role as an opportunity to combine my academic knowledge of economics and strategic business management with my practical experience in commodity trading and financial markets.",
      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "I want to work for EDF Trading because it is at the forefront of global energy markets and plays a pivotal role in the energy transition as part of the EDF Group. My placement at Trafigura in Colombia gave me first-hand exposure to commodity trading and logistics, where I shadowed the coal trading desk and supported deal execution. That experience confirmed my passion for the energy industry, particularly in understanding how trading strategies and risk management underpin the movement of commodities globally.

The rotational structure is particularly appealing because it allows me to explore multiple areas of the business, from trading to risk and analytics, before committing to a defined path. This aligns perfectly with my experience at Cantor Fitzgerald, where I rotated across market making, derivatives, and M&A, and with Trafigura, where I worked closely with traders and logistics teams. I thrive in environments where I can learn from different perspectives, and EDFT\u2019s commitment to coaching, mentoring, and networking ensures that development is built into every stage of the programme. The chance to work on live projects that directly impact the business, while being part of a global team in London, makes this an exceptional opportunity. For me, this role represents the perfect bridge between my academic studies, my passion for trading and energy markets, and my ambition to build a long-term career in the sector."

What stands out to me is the opportunity to rotate across functions such as trading, risk, analytics, and origination, each offering a distinct perspective on how value is created and managed within the business. Rather than focusing on a single role from the outset, the programme allows graduates to build a broad skillset, test their strengths in different environments, and develop a commercial mindset that is essential for long-term success in energy markets.\n\nI see this role as much more than training; it\u2019s a chance to contribute meaningfully to live projects while being supported by mentoring, technical development, and exposure to senior decision-makers. The fast-paced and data-driven environment of a trading floor particularly excites me, as it combines quantitative rigour with strategic thinking and real-world impact.

I am drawn to EDFT\u2019s reputation for combining analytical expertise with entrepreneurial spirit, encouraging graduates not only to learn but also to contribute ideas that can make a difference. The global reach of the business, paired with its inclusive and supportive culture, offers the chance to grow in an environment that values diversity of thought and perspective.\n\nJoining EDF Trading represents an opportunity to apply my financial and analytical skills in a fast-paced, data-driven setting, while being part of a company directly shaping the energy transition.

      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "What stands out to me most about this Graduate Programme is the opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of the energy trading industry through structured rotations across four key areas. The ability to explore trading, market risk, analytics, and origination within one programme is unique, and I am particularly drawn to the balance between developing strong quantitative and analytical skills while also gaining commercial exposure to client-facing and strategic functions. This breadth of experience will not only allow me to build a solid foundation in energy markets but also help me identify where my strengths and interests can have the greatest impact.\n\nI am also excited by the prospect of joining a fast-paced trading floor environment while being supported by structured training, mentoring, and professional development. The chance to work on real business projects from day one and interact regularly with commercial teams and leaders is highly appealing, as it ensures that my learning is both practical and impactful.\n\nFurthermore, EDF Trading\u2019s position at the forefront of European power and gas markets, backed by the EDF Group\u2019s global reputation in low-carbon energy, makes this programme especially attractive. The energy sector is undergoing rapid transformation, and the chance to contribute to a company that plays such a pivotal role in shaping sustainable energy markets strongly aligns with my personal interests.\n\nFinally, the programme\u2019s emphasis on diversity, collaboration, and innovation stands out to me. I value the opportunity to work in an environment where new ideas are encouraged, where colleagues from diverse backgrounds come together to achieve common goals, and where respect and adaptability are at the core of success."

      "Why do you want to work for EDF Trading?": "Dear EDF Trading Recruitment Team,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in the Commercial Graduate Programme at EDF Trading. With a degree in Economics with Finance from the University of Edinburgh and hands-on experience in entrepreneurial and operational settings, I am eager to develop a deep understanding of energy markets while contributing to EDF\u2019s mission of optimising assets and enabling the energy transition.\n\nI have been following EDF\u2019s recent initiatives closely, and your involvement in the Thorpe Marsh Battery Energy Storage project particularly stood out to me. Delivering 560 MW of storage capacity, this project will play a crucial role in balancing the grid, improving system flexibility, and unlocking more value from renewable generation. It highlights how EDF Trading\u2019s work goes beyond market participation to actively shaping how assets respond to price signals and system needs. This focus on combining trading expertise with technological and operational innovation is exactly what excites me about joining EDFT.\n\nMy academic background has given me a strong foundation in analysis and data-driven thinking. In my dissertation, \u201cEvaluating the Economic Impact of National AI Activity: A Panel Data Analysis of GDP Correlations\u201d, I applied econometric techniques using STATA to identify relationships between innovation and economic growth. This experience taught me how to work with complex datasets and distil them into insights that inform decision-making, skills that are directly relevant to understanding market dynamics and supporting trading strategies.\n\nBeyond academia, I have consistently sought opportunities to combine commercial thinking, problem-solving, and execution. At No Headquarters, a London startup, I designed and implemented a client acquisition strategy that secured the company\u2019s largest client to date. Founding Ticcal Ltd, a ticketing technology venture, required detailed market research, pitch development, and the coding of a working MVP, which taught me how to turn ideas into actionable solutions. At Borana Lodge in Kenya, I was responsible for tracking stock and revenue accurately and presenting results to management, sharpening my attention to detail and operational discipline.\n\nYours sincerely,\nCameron Mahal",
      "What is it about this Graduate position that stands out for you?": "I am particularly drawn to the rotational structure of the programme because it offers the chance to work across trading, market risk, analytics, and origination and build a complete understanding of how EDF Trading operates. I like that I would not just observe but contribute to real projects that support the trading floor, while developing the commercial judgment and analytical skills needed to succeed in energy markets. Working alongside experienced traders and analysts is an exciting prospect because I enjoy learning by doing and applying insights quickly; something I have done before when securing the largest client for No Headquarters and when building Ticcal\u2019s MVP under time pressure. The programme feels like an environment where I could grow quickly while also adding value from day one."
